# Introduction  

Foundation species are spatially dominant structure forming taxa that form the base of entire ecosystems [@bruno2001; @altieri2014].
Positive interactions, or facilitation between species, are particularly important in shaping ecosystems formed by foundation species [@bruno2003; @bulleri2009; @zhang2019].
Traditionally, research has focused on the mechanisms of facilitation by foundation species and the consequences for community-level diversity and abundance [e.g., @hughes2014; @borst2018; @archer2020a].
However, foundation species are often facilitated by members of their associated assemblages [@gagnon2020; @peterson2013; @ellison1996] and it is becoming increasingly evident how important these interactions may be for ecosystem stability [@vanderheide2020].\par

Recent theoretical work by van der Heide et al. (2020) showed that facultative facilitation of foundation species has the potential to create non-linear ecosystem dynamics in response to stressors. 
Such interactions can increase the range of environmental conditions over which ecosystem degradation will continue once it has begun.
Consequently, it is important to understand which species facilitate foundation species, particularly in vulnerable coastal ecosystems.\par

Seagrass beds are an important coastal ecosystem worldwide. 
They help to attenuate wave energy [@fonseca1992] and stabilize sediments [@folmer2012], store large amounts of carbon [@fourqurean2012], and are important sites for nutrient cycling [@hemminga1991]. 
Seagrass beds also act as hot spots of productivity with diverse and abundant communities of macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish [@duffy2006]. 
The communities associated with seagrass beds also maintain important links with other coastal ecosystems, such as coral reefs, by acting as a nursery habitat [@heck2003; @adams2006] and as feeding grounds [@meyer1983; @yeager2012]. 
Unfortunately, myriad anthropogenic stressors have resulted in significant worldwide declines in the extent of seagrass habitats [@orth2006; @waycott2009].\par
 
As foundation species, seagrasses are often facilitated by filter feeders, such as bivalves [@gagnon2020]. 
Bivalves can facilitate seagrasses through a variety of mechanisms including decreasing turbidity [e.g., @wall2008] and increasing nutrient availability [e.g., @reusch1994]. 
Sponges, common in tropical and sub-tropical seagrass meadows [@archer2015], are also efficient filter feeders [@reiswig1971; @reiswig1974]. 
Although sponges have the potential to strongly impact nutrient availability [@southwell2008a; @degoeij2013; @archer2017], how they influence seagrasses and other associated primary producers is generally not well-understood. 
Despite the paucity of studies, there is some evidence that sponges can influence the growth and abundance of seagrass in a context-dependent manner [@archer2015; @archer2018c].\par

In the present study we investigate the impact of a large sponge, *Ircinia felix*, on seagrass bed primary producers. 
Using a 1.5 yr long field-based experiment, we examine how sponge presence influences macroalgal abundance and the abundance, growth, and nutrient content of seagrasses. 
*Ircinia felix* is a high microbial abundance sponge; meaning it hosts a dense and diverse microbiome [@weisz2008]. 
As a result, the *I. felix* holobiont (sponge and its associated microbiome) is capable of complex nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) transformations [@southwell2008a; @archer2017]. 
In our study system in The Bahamas, primary production is often co-limited by nitrogen and phosphorus [@allgeier2010]. 
Therefore, we hypothesize that the presence of the sponge *I. felix* will facilitate both macroalgae and seagrasses resulting in more abundant and faster growing primary producer communities.\par

# Methods  

## Study site and experimental design  

This study was conducted in a shallow (1.1 m low tide depth) seagrass bed located off of Southern Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas (26.02610 N, 77.37408 W). 
Fifteen 5 x 5 m plots were delineated in a continuous seagrass bed on June 9, 2013 by placing wooden stakes at the corners and center of each plot. 
All plots were separated >2 m. All variables (see below) were measured once prior to the establishment of the treatments, and again 1, 5, 12, and 17 months after the treatments were established. 
After preliminary data were collected, each plot was randomly assigned to one of three treatments: control (n=5), structure control (n=5), or sponge (n=5; Fig. S1). 
A polypropylene model of a sponge was placed inside a cage at the center of each structure control plot. 
A single sponge (*I. felix*, average volume ± standard deviation, 2.5 ± 0.75 L) was placed inside a cage in the center of each sponge plot. Control plots were not manipulated. 
Live sponges were replaced as needed with a total of 3 individual sponge replacements, all occurring within the first month of the experiment. 

## Primary producer response variables  

Primary producers (seagrasses and macroalgae) were quantified within three 1x1 m quadrats at increasing distances from the center of each plot. 
The 0 distance quadrat was placed around the sponge or sponge model (sponge and structural control plots) or the center (control plots). 
The 1 m distance quadrat was placed immediately adjacent to the 0 distance quadrat, extending from 0.5-1.5 m away from the center point of the plot and the 2 m distance quadrat covered an area 1.5-2.5 m away from the center point (Fig. S1). 
Macroalgae were identified to genus and counts were summed across the three 1 m^2^ quadrats. 
Where individuals were difficult to distinguish (e.g. *Laurencia* spp.) clumps of algae were recorded as individuals. 
If identification was not possible *in situ*, a representative sample was photographed and subsequently collected. 
Three species of seagrass were observed in the experimental plots: *T. testudinum*, *Syringodium filliforme*, and *Halodule wrightii*. 
Shoots densities of these species were counted within four 20 cm x 20 cm "sub-quadrats" that were placed haphazardly within each of the quadrats described above. 
*S. filliforme* and *H. wrightii* were initially rare and patchily distributed (combined density (mean ± sd) of 149.2 ± 172 shoots m^-2^, compared to *T. testudinum*'s initial density of 788.1 ± 386.2 shoots m^-2^). 
Therefore our counts of *S. filliforme* and *H. wrightii* were pooled, and growth and nutrient content were only measured in *T. testudinum*. 
Growth rates of *T. testudinum* shoots were measured at four distances from the center of each plot: the center of the plot or immediately next to the sponge, or polypropylene model of the sponge (designated as 0 m) and in permanently marked points (using stakes) at 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 2.0 m away from the center of the plot. 
Growth rates were calculated using the standard blade hole punching technique [@zieman1974] on five short *T. testudinum* shoots per distance. 
Approximately two weeks after the blades were marked growth was measured *in situ* in order to minimize disturbance to the plots. 
Nutrient content (%C, %N, and %P) was assessed for 10 shoots growing near the center of each plot, prior to the beginning of the experiment and again after 1 year. 
The second youngest blade from each shoot was collected, combined with other blades from the same plot and sampling period, and dried at 60ºC for 48-72 hours. 
For %C and %N analysis seagrass tissue was then weighed into tin capsules, and sent to the University of Georgia Stable Isotope Ecology Laboratory for analysis. 
Percent phosphorus (%P) was determined by dry oxidation acid hydrolysis extraction followed by colorimetric analysis [@fourqurean1992].  
  
## Statistical analysis  
  
Two sampling events occurred in the summer (1 and 12 months into the experiment) and two in the winter (5 and 17 months into the experiment); therefore, all response variables were visually examined for a seasonal effect. 
If responses differed noticeably between summer and winter, separate factors for season and year of the experiment (1st or 2nd year) were included as explanatory variables in those analyses, otherwise a continuous effect of months into experiment was the only temporal variable. 
In either case, the effects of temporal variables were allowed to interact with experimental treatment (control, structure control, or sponge), but season and year were only allowed to interact with each other when included as random slopes (for algal abundance only).  

Macroalgal abundances were fit with a negative binomial distribution and a log link.
Overall abundance did fluctuate seasonally, so we included fixed effects of treatment, year, and season, and random slopes for the effect of season and year for each taxa. 
This provides an estimate of the overall treatment effect between years and seasons, as well as taxa-specific differences in these effects.  

Shoot densities (counts of shoots m^-2^) were fit with a quasi-poisson distribution and a log link. 
Seagrass shoots did not fluctuate between seasons, so we included fixed effects of months into experiment in a three-way interaction with treatment and distance (a linear covariate representing the center of contiguous 1 m^2^ sampling quadrats). 
Because species-specific shoot counts were not collected for *S. filliforme* or *H. wrightii*, shoot density was modelled for *T. testudinum* alone as the dominant species and for *S. filliforme* and *H. wrightii* combined.  

*T. testudinum* growth rate (mm^2^ day^-1^) was analyzed in response to treatment interacting separately with fixed effects of distance, season, and year, as well as stake ID as an additional random factor. 
We tested for a treatment effect at each distance sampled (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 m) to identify a potential threshold of response. 
Because an effect was detected at 0 and 0.5 m and not at the 1 m or 2 m sampling points, distance was included in this model as a factor with 0 and 0.5 m assigned as "near" and 1 and 2 m assigned as "far".  

Finally, we tested for a treatment effect on nutrient concentrations (% of nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus) in *T. testudinum* shoots one year into the experiment, as compared to samples collected prior to the experiment. 
  
All models described above included plot as a random factor, along with any additional random effects as described above. 
For all response variables except nutrient concentrations, an offset of the mean values measured prior to the initiation of the experiment was included (when a log link was used, this value had 1 added to it and was log transformed). 
Macroalgal abundance and seagrass shoot densities were assessed using generalized mixed effect models implemented using the glmmTMB package [@brooks2017]; distribution and link described above. 
All other variables were modeled linear mixed effects models using the lme4 package [@bates2015]. 
All analyses were completed in R version 4.0.2 [@rcoreteam2020]. **could add statement about how differences between treatments are reported**

## Macroalgal abundance  
```{r algae, include=FALSE}
source("scripts/04_algae_analysis.R")
```  
  
Macroalgal abundances decreased in the winter in all treatments, however, the decrease was only significant in control ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(alm1b.sum,5)`). 
Macroalgal abundances did not change significantly between the first and second year of the experiment in control or structure control plots(Fig. \@ref(fig:algaep)).  
However, macroalgal abundances increased in sponge treatments in year two of the experiment ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(alm1r.sum,4)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:algaep)). 
The control and structure control plots both increased significantly less than the sponge treatments ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(alm1r.sum,6)` and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(alm1r.sum,7)` respectively) and did not differ from each other (Table S1).
  
## Shoot densities
```{r shoot.density, include=FALSE}
source("scripts/07_shoots_analysis.R")
```  
  
*Thalassia testudinum* shoot densities decreased similarly in all treatments over time, but this decrease was not significant in sponge plots (control: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(tsdb.sum,4)`; structure control: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(tsdf.sum,4)`. 
There was no significant effect of distance for any treatment initially or over time. 
*Syringodium filiforme* and *H. wrightii* shoot densities did not change in control or structure control plots, but increased in sponge plots ( $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(shsdr.sum,4)`). 
The increase in sponge plots was significantly different than both control ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(shsdr.sum,6)`) and structure control plots ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(shsdr.sum,7)`). 
Initially, *S. filiforme* and *H. wrightii* were more abundant at further distances from the center of sponge plots ( $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(shsdr.sum,5)`). 
However, over time *S. filiforme* and *H. wrightii* increased more near the center of sponge plots (time * distance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(shsdr.sum,10)`). 
There was no significant effect of distance at any point in control or structure control plots.  

## *Thalassia testudinum* growth  
```{r growth, include=FALSE}
source("scripts/05_growth_analysis.R")
```
  
Seagrass growth was impacted by treatment at 0 (F~`r aov.df2(sg0,1)`~`r aov.res2(sg0,1)`) and 0.5 m (F~`r aov.df2(sg05,1)`~`r aov.res2(sg05,1)`) but this effect had disappeared by 1 m. 
As a result, we pooled seagrass growth for the near (0 and 0.5 m) and far (1 and 2 m) distances for further analysis. 
Seagrass growth was slower in the winter ($\beta$ = `r efsize(sgr,6)`) and the decrease in growth during the winter was not different between treatments. 
In sponge plots, seagrass grew slower in the further distances from the sponge ($\beta$ = `r efsize(sgr,4)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:grow)). 
There was no difference in seagrass growth between distances in the control or structure control plots. 
In sponge plots, seagrass grew faster in the second year of the experiment ($\beta$ = `r efsize(sgr,5)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:grow)). 
In contrast, seagrass growth declined in the control and structure control plots , but this decline was only significant in the control ($\beta$ = `r efsize(sgb,5)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:grow)).  
  
## *Thalassia testudinum* nutrient concentrations  
```{r nutrients, include=FALSE}
source("scripts/06_nutrient_analysis.R")
```
  
Before the the experiment, seagrass in sponge plots had significantly lower nitrogen concentrations than control plots (Fig. \@ref(fig:nuts)A, $\beta$ = `r efsize(nbs,3)`) but not structure control plots. 
Percent nitrogen in seagrass tissues in both control and structure control plots declined similarly over time (Fig. \@ref(fig:nuts)A), but the decrease was only significant in control plots ($\beta$ = `r efsize(nbs,4)`). 
Conversely, seagrass in sponge plots responded differently than both the control ($\beta$ = `r efsize(nrs,5)`) and structure control ($\beta$ = `r efsize(nrs,6)`) plots. Sponge plots had a higher % nitrogen after one year (Fig. \@ref(fig:nuts)A), however, this increase was not significant.  
  
The pattern was similar for percent carbon; seagrass in sponge plots was initially lower than control (Fig. \@ref(fig:nuts)B, $\beta$ = `r efsize(cbs,3)`) and structure control plots ($\beta$ = `r efsize(cfs,3)`). 
Again, percent carbon in seagrass tissue decreased in a similar way in both control and structure control plots (Fig. \@ref(fig:nuts)B). 
However, this decrease was only significant in structure control plots ($\beta$ = `r efsize(cfs,4)`). 
In sponge plots, % carbon showed a slight increase in seagrass tissues, resulting in a significantly different response than structure control plots ($\beta$ = `r efsize(crls,6)`) but not control plots.  
  
Phosphorus concentrations were similar in all plot types at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. \@ref(fig:nuts)C. 
Although % phosphorus in seagrass tissues followed the same patterns as both % nitrogen and % carbon, decreasing in control and structure control plots while increasing in sponge plots, none of these changes were significant(Fig. \@ref(fig:nuts)C). 
However, the pattern of change over time was significantly different between control and sponge plots ($\beta$ = `r efsize(pbs,6)`), but not between structure control and sponge plots or control and structure control plots. 
  
  
# Discussion  
Facilitation plays an important role in structuring seagrass ecosystems. 
Research has largely focused on how seagrasses facilitate other organisms. 
However, knowing which taxa facilitate seagrasses is equally important for understanding long-term seagrass bed dynamics in the face of a changing ocean.    
Here, we show that the sponge, *Ircinia felix*, facilitates seagrass bed primary producers.
Specifically, sponge presents results in increased seagrass nutrient content and growth and increased abundance of both macroalgae and seagrasses.\par  

Start with nutrient result
transition into how we see what we would expect to see in the rest of the community (increased abundance and growth)
talk about how other facilitation relationships based on nutrient supply can prove unstable under increased nutrient loads, then why this interaction may be different.
Finish with need to study this interaction under different nutrient-loading scenarios.

1. discuss increased primary producer abundance.
Things to cover - how does this relate to studies of other filter feeders in seagrass beds?

2. increase in seagrass growth close to sponges

3. likely driven by increasing nutrient availability
  - discuss increase in n and P in sponge plots. 
  - cover findings that this sponge can be a source of both N and P
  
4. How nutrients supplied by filter feeders can sometimes be a context-dependent benefit to seagrasses and why that might not be the case here
  - example of thalassia and h. melanadocia
  - example of bivalves
  - results of my 2017 paper showing that i felix can be a source or a sink for both N and P, becoming a sink when ambient N and/or P are high
  - need future work to determine if this means that this sponge, and others that process nutrients in similar ways, may be a stabilizing factor in seagrass beds?
  
Seagrasses are often facilitated by filter feeders, such as bivalves, increasing nutrient availability [@gagnon2020]. 

Seagrass growth is co-limited by nitrogen and phosphorus in shallow waters of The Bahamas [@allgeier2010]. 
The sponge used in this experiment, *I. felix*, is capable of complex nutrient transformations (Southwell et al., 2008). 
The nutrients supplied by the sponge is the most likely driver of the increase in both seagrass growth and shoot densities. 
We saw a shift in the seagrass community towards an increase in S. filliforme and H. wrightii. 
This result is consistent with increased nutrient supply in similar systems, as both Powell et al. (1989) and  Fourqurean et al. (1995) found that the addition of nutrients in the form of bird guano shifted the dominant seagrass species in a Florida Bay seagrass bed from T. testudinum to H. wrightii. 


**Finella's notes for discussion**
*1.Sponges enhance primary producers. Context dependent sponge facilitation in seagrass beds.*  
*2.How sponges facilitate primary production in seagrass beds? Hook: concept that interactions that facilitate foundation species can help lead to non linear dynamics in systems.*
*3.Dampening cycle version? Source and sink depending on changes in microbiom in sponge. % Nitrogen increases or decreases based on sponge.Helps regulate nutrient concentrations.*
*4.Might want to mention how the cage could have affected the result. Cage has a structural component that could influence community and is metal (iron is a limiting factor in system).*
*5. Offset explanation?*
*6. The reason for significant difference found in shoot densities at further distance is because Steph had trouble finding seagrass beds big enough. So, some of the far distances were on the edge of the seagrass beds and was already less dense to start.*
*7. Talk about shoot density differences between species?*
*8. Should we mention Ircinia being a coral reef sponge typically.* - for community paper
*9. Mention of sponges growing on the seagrass*
*10. Add in a map of study site?*
*11. A single organism that changes an entire ecosystem. Ecosystem engineer?*
*12. Comparrison of sponge/seagrass and clam/seagrass interaction and that sponge/seagrass is more stable.*
