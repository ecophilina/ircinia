  abstract = {Coral reefs typically occur in oligotrophic waters, where tight recycling of energy and nutrients is essential in order to support their high productivity. Sponges are efficient filter feeders that host diverse and abundant microbial communities that often contain members capable of carrying out complex nutrient transformations. Consequently, sponges often act as significant sources of bioavailable forms of nitrogen and phosphorus while acting as sinks for dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, little attention has focused on variability of nutrient release by sponges and no studies have reported how abiotic conditions may impact sponge-driven changes in nutrient concentrations. Here, we show that a common Caribbean sponge, Ircinia felix, is capable of being both a source and a sink for DOC, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite (NO2x ), and phosphate (PO432). Additionally, we show that abiotic conditions, particularly ambient nutrient availability, seem to explain a significant amount of the variability (R2 range from 0.40 to 0.65). Interestingly, as ambient nutrient concentrations increased, I. felix transitioned from acting as a source to serving as a sink for all nutrient forms measured. We also found I. felix-associated bacteria exhibit a significantly higher abundance of predicted nitrogen metabolism, carbon fixation, and photosynthetic genes relative to ambient water and sediment. These results suggest that sponges play an important and dynamic role in biogeochemical cycling on reefs, particularly as human activities alter natural nutrient dynamics in coastal systems.},

  abstract = {Seagrass beds are important coastal ecosystems worldwide that are shaped by facilitative interactions. Consequently, it is important to identify which taxa facilitate seagrasses. In other ecosystems, sponges contribute to the maintenance of diverse and productive systems through their facilitation of foundation species (e.g., mangroves) and the retention and recycling of energy and nutrients. Sponges are common in tropical and subtropical seagrass beds, yet we know little about how their presence impacts these communities. Here, we examine the impact of the sponge Ircinia felix on primary producers in a Thalassia testudinum dominated seagrass bed using a long-term field experiment in The Bahamas. We transplanted live sponges into the center of 5\,\texttimes\,5~m plots and monitored the response of seagrasses and macroalgae. Sponge presence increased seagrass nutrient content and growth, as well as the abundance of macroalgae and non-dominant seagrass species (Syringodium filiforme and Halodule wrightii). These changes were not seen in the control (unmanipulated) or structure (where we placed a polypropylene sponge replica) plots. We conclude that I. felix facilitates seagrass bed primary producers in oligotrophic systems, likely due to nutrients supplied by the sponge. Our study shows that sponges can have a positive influence on seagrass bed foundation species. Since recent theoretical work emphasizes the potential for facilitative interactions involving foundation species to be destabilized in the face of anthropogenic change, further work, is needed to understand how this facilitation impacts the stability of seagrass beds in areas where human activities have increased ambient nutrient levels.},

One unique feature of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its ability to estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized by the mean.

In addition to the direct loss of the exploited species, the very act of fishing, particularly with mobile bottom gear, destroys habitat and ultimately results in the loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, overfishing can create trophic cascades in marine communities that cause similar declines in species richness. These effects are compounded by indirect effects on habitat that occur through removal of ecological or ecosystem engineers. Mass removal of species that restructure the architecture of habitat and thus increase its complexity or influence the biogeochemistry of sediments could have devastating effects on local biodiversity and important water\textendash sediment processes. The possible overexploitation of engineering species requires more attention because the consequences extend beyond their own decline to affect the rest of the ecosystem. This is particularly problematic in the deep ocean, where oil and gas exploration and fishing pressure are likely to increase.}

Understanding patterns of distribution of sessile epifaunal communities in seagrass meadows is an important precursor to determining the processes driving their distribution and species interactions. This study (1) identified the sponge and ascidian assemblage associated with Posidonia australis meadows and (2) determined distributional patterns of these invertebrates at a hierarchy of spatial scales in Jervis Bay, Australia. We used a fully nested design with transects distributed in the seagrass (10s m apart), two sites (100s m apart), and six locations (km apart). Within these transects, we recorded the abundance, volume, diversity and substratum used for attachment by sponges and ascidians. We encountered 20 sponge species and eight ascidian species; they were sporadically distributed in the seagrass meadows with high variability among the transects, sites and locations. A few sponge and ascidian species dominated the assemblage and were widespread across the largest spatial scale sampled. The remaining species were mostly rare and sparsely distributed. Sponges attached to a variety of substrata but most notably shells, P. australis and polychaete tubes. No obligate seagrass species were recorded although three species predominantly used P. australis as a substratum. These sponge species relying heavily on seagrass for their attachment are likely prone to disturbances impacting their host habitat. Examining the response of sessile epifauna to the degradation of their seagrass habitat remains a key challenge for the future.},

It measured rugosity, variety of growth forms, height, refuge size categories, percentage live cover and percentage hard substratum. Multiple regression models using HAS variables as predictors accounted for 71 and 22\% of the variation in observed species richness and total fish abundance respectively. The two most important predictors of observed species richness were rugosity and variety of growth forms, while height was the most important predictor of total fish abundance. The HAS method worked consistently across a variety of habitat types and the complexity map closely mirrored the map of observed species richness, reflecting the patchy habitat mosaic of shallow tropical marine areas. Stations at the mouth of an enclosed lagoon, however, had a higher number of species than might have been expected judging from the habitat complexity scores. It is possible that this was linked to the preferential settling of pelagic fish larvae in this area as tidal water exchanges between the bay and the reef were funnelled through one small gap. This study highlights the need for fish biodiversity studies to take habitat complexity into account.},

Benthic community data were analysed from videos and photographs collected using SCUBA ({$<$} 30 m) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) ({$>$} 30 m). We found significant changes in community composition with depth at all locations, suggesting that TMEs provide habitats different from those in shallower water. We consistently found that TME benthic communities were dominated by sponges, but their abundance varied significantly with depth at 3 out of 4 locations, while the morphological composition of these assemblages changed with depth at all locations. Given their particularly high abundance and morphological complexity, we suggest that sponge assemblages make an important contribution to habitat complexity in benthic TME communities.},

In this study, we standardized simulated seagrass shoot density and bed area among artificial seagrass beds in San Diego Bay, California, USA to evaluate the singular effect of seagrass bed configuration (``patchiness'') on the density and diversity of seagrass epifauna. Artificial seagrass beds all were 1 m2, but were composed of a single large patch (``continuous'' treatment), four smaller patches (``patchy'' treatment), or 16 very small patches (``very patchy'' treatment). We allowed epifauna to colonize beds for 1 month, and then sampled beds monthly over the next 3 months. Effects of seagrass bed patchiness on total epifaunal density and species-specific densities were highly variable among sampling dates, and there was no general trend for the effects of fragmentation on epifaunal densities to be positive or negative. Epifaunal diversity (measured as Simpson's index of diversity) was highest in very patchy or patchy beds on two out of the three sampling dates. Very patchy beds exhibited the highest dissimilarity in community composition in the first two sampling periods (August and September), but patchy beds exhibited the highest dissimilarity in the third sampling period (October). Our results indicate that seagrass patch configuration affects patterns of epifaunal density, diversity, and community composition in the absence of covarying bed area or structural complexity, and that patchy seagrass beds may be no less valuable as a habitat than are continuous seagrass beds. The spatial pattern employed when harvesting or planting seagrass may influence epifaunal habitat use and should be a key consideration in restoration plans.}

This note illustrates how CMP distributions can be parametrized via the mean, so that simpler and more easily interpretable mean-models can be used, such as a log-linear model. Other link functions are also available, of course. In addition to establishing attractive theoretical and asymptotic properties of the proposed model, its good finite-sample performance is exhibited through various examples and a simulation study based on real datasets. Moreover, the MATLAB routine to fit the model to data is demonstrated to be up to an order of magnitude faster than the current software to fit standard CMP models, and over two orders of magnitude faster than the recently proposed hyper-Poisson model.},

In the presence of artificial seagrass, seahorses used ``sit and wait'' foraging behavior, but in the absence of structure, seahorses actively pursued prey. Even the highest seagrass densities did not significantly reduce seahorse captures of their shrimp [Hippo\&e zostericola (Smith)] prey, in contrast to the reduced capture rates often reported for actively foraging fish predators in dense vegetation. However, capture rates were significantly reduced at low light levels, even though seahorses were able to capture small numbers of shrimp in 0 light treatments. We conclude that variation in structural complexity appears to have little effect on the foraging success of this visual ``sit and wait'' predator, while variation in light level produces significant shifts in capture rates.}

H. thomsoni, H. infundibulum, H. lusitanicum and H. toxeras - is fully described and illustrated. It is characterized by the notched, bill-shaped tips of neurosetae, smooth cephalic sensory organs and cirri, and smooth margined elytra with a patch of papillae near the reniform indentation. The species shows sexual dimorphism and the morphology of the polychaetes changes slightly when comparing specimens from Mediterranean hosts to those of Atlantic hosts. Some trends of the association between the polychaete and the sponge have been studied on a dense population of Mediterranean H. thomsoni (including 171 of the total 176 hexactinellid specimens examined). 88.3\% of the sponges were infested by the polychaete, with 52.3\% of them harbouring a male and female together. The absence of correlation between sponge size and polychaete size, together with their particular distributions in size-classes (normal unimodal in sponges, and bimodal in polychaetes), suggest that the life-history of the polychaete population is independent of the host, with sponge life being notably longer than inquiline life.}

The aim was to investigate patterns of seasonal use, cap making behaviour, cap turnover, the effect of intraspecific interactions on cap life and the effect of movement of crabs between hosts on background matching. C. hilgendorfi uses 12 (of 16 available) species of sponge and 3 species of ascidians to construct caps, which are carried by the crabs using their last two pairs of legs. Cap area increases non-linearly with crab size, and caps are normally two to three times as large as the crabs. Cap making behaviour is described. It occurs during intermoult periods, with females making most of their caps at night. Caps decrease in size with time, but conceal the crabs which commonly occupy exposed sites on sponges. Cap life is independent of crab size, differs between different cap species and is influenced by the presence of other crabs who can dislodge caps through aggressive behaviour. Caps are made from the sponge Suberites carnosus more often than from other available sponges. S. carnosus caps also decay less rapidly than caps made from other sponges. Use of sponge and ascidian species varies seasonally, with Halichondria sp. and S. carnosus being used in all months. C. hilgendorfi exhibits a preference for certain sponges. The majority of crabs carried caps which matched their host sponge or ascidian, but mis-matches varied seasonally with a winter peak following the breeding season. Young C. hilgendorfi settle only on S. carnosus sponges and disperse from this host to other species in the environment. Males and females differ in their rate of discovery of new hosts. Males, despite their greater mobility, find new hosts slower than females. It is hypothesized that males occupy ``home ranges'' which females do not. Crabs frequently move between sponges, mostly at night. Sponges and ascidian species grow in intimate association with each other, and sponge crabs act a selective asexual propagation mechanism. Depending upon the nature of the interactions between sponge and ascidian species (co-operative or competitive) and whether competitive hierarchies or networks are involved, the sponge crabs may have either stabilizing or destabilizing effects on the sponge community.}

To understand how the demands of juvenile fish on seagrass nursery functions determines the timing of ontogenetic habitat shifts from seagrass beds to coral reefs, we conducted visual transect survey and field tethering and caging experiments on three different sizes of the coral reef fish Pacific yellowtail emperor (Lethrinus atkinsoni) during its juvenile tenure in seagrass beds at Ishigaki Island, southern Japan. The study showed that although the number of individual L. atkinsoni juveniles decreased by {$>$}90~\% during their stay in the seagrass nursery, the shelter and/or food availability functions of the nursery, at least for a juvenile size of approximately 5~cm total length (TL), provided the best survival and growth option. The timing of ontogenetic migration to coral reefs of larger fish ({$>$}8~cm TL) was attributed to foraging efficiency for larger food items in different habitats. Overall, the function of the seagrass bed nursery changed with juvenile body size, with marginally higher survival and significantly greater growth rates during early juvenile stages in seagrass beds compared to coral reefs. This would contribute to the enhancement in the number of individuals eventually recruited to adult populations.}

  abstract = {The recognition that all macroorganisms live in symbiotic association with microbial communities has opened up a new field in biology. Animals, plants, and algae are now considered holobionts, complex ecosystems consisting of the host, the microbiota, and the interactions among them. Accordingly, ecological concepts can be applied to understand the host-derived and microbial processes that govern the dynamics of the interactive networks within the holobiont. In marine systems, holobionts are further integrated into larger and more complex communities and ecosystems, a concept referred to as ``nested ecosystems.'' In this review, we discuss the concept of holobionts as dynamic ecosystems that interact at multiple scales and respond to environmental change. We focus on the symbiosis of sponges with their microbial communities\textemdash a symbiosis that has resulted in one of the most diverse and complex holobionts in the marine environment. In recent years, the field of sponge microbiology has remarkably advanced in terms of curated databases, standardized protocols, and information on the functions of the microbiota. Like a Russian doll, these microbial processes are translated into sponge holobiont functions that impact the surrounding ecosystem. For example, the sponge-associated microbial metabolisms, fueled by the high filtering capacity of the sponge host, substantially affect the biogeochemical cycling of key nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous. Since sponge holobionts are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic stressors that jeopardize the stability of the holobiont ecosystem, we discuss the link between environmental perturbations, dysbiosis, and sponge diseases. Experimental studies suggest that the microbial community composition is tightly linked to holobiont health, but whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of holobiont collapse remains unresolved. Moreover, the potential role of the microbiome in mediating the capacity for holobionts to acclimate and adapt to environmental change is unknown. Future studies should aim to identify the mechanisms underlying holobiont dynamics at multiple scales, from the microbiome to the ecosystem, and develop management strategies to preserve the key functions provided by the sponge holobiont in our present and future oceans.}

In eleven of these, sponges comprised 6\% or more of the stomach contents; it is assumed that these fishes feed intentionally on sponges. Sponges comprise over 95\% of the food of angelfishes of the genus Holacanthus, over 70\% of the food of species of the related genus Pomacanthus, and more than 85\% of the food of the filefish, Cantherhines macrocerus. Lesser quantities of sponges are ingested by the remaining fish species. Fishes that feed on sponges belong to highly specialized teleost families, suggesting that this habit has evolved in geologically late time. The small number of fish species that concentrate on sponges as food suggests that the defensive characters of sponges\textemdash mineralized sclerites, noxious chemical substances, and tough fibrous components\textemdash are highly effective in discouraging predation. The two sponges most frequently eaten by fishes have a low percentage of siliceous spicules relative to organic matter, but among the 20 next most frequently consumed species no striking correlation occurs with respect to spicule content. Color and form of the sponge show no special correlation with frequency of occurrence in fish stomachs. Three species of fishes appear to concentrate on one species of sponge, but in these cases over 60\% of the food taken consists of a variety of other organisms. Those fishes, more than half of whose diet consists of sponges, tend to sample a wide variety of species. No strong evidence is provided by our data that fish predation is a significant factor in limiting sponge distribution in the West Indian region.}

On a 600- m(2) section of Conch Reef, species-specific biomass for all nonencrusting sponges was measured. The biomass data combined with species-specific dissolved inorganic nitrogen ( DIN) flux rates yielded the benthic DIN flux from 14 species, and allowed us to extrapolate these data to the total nonencrusting sponge community. The species for which we measured DIN fluxes represented 85\% of the nonencrusting sponge biomass in the study area and released a combined 480 +/- 93 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) of nitrate plus nitrite, and 57 +/- 73 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) of ammonium. Approximately 73\% of the measured DIN flux was produced by Xestospongia muta, a massive barrel sponge. Of the 14 species studied, 10 hosted active nitrifying communities, and 8 hosted photosynthetic microbial associates. However, the presence of these microbial communities had no apparent effect on the magnitude of the total DIN flux. We estimate that the DIN flux for the entire nonencrusting sponge community is 640 +/- 130 mu mol m(-2) h(-1).},

This dichotomy has previously been suggested to correlate with morphological differences, with HMA species having a denser mesohyl and a more complex aquiferous systems composed of longer and narrower water canals that should necessitate slower seawater filtration rates. We measured mesohyl density for a variety of HMA and LMA sponges in the Florida Keys, and seawater pumping rates for a select group of these sponges using an in situ dye technique. HMA sponges were substantially denser than LMA species, and had per unit volume pumping rates 52-94\% slower than the LMA sponges. These density and pumping rate differences suggest that evolutionary differences between HMA and LMA species may have resulted in profound morphological and physiological differences between the two groups. The LMA sponge body plan moves large quantities of water through their porous tissues allowing them to rapidly acquire the small particulate organic matter (POM) that supplies the majority of their nutritional needs. In contrast, the HMA sponge body plan is suited to host large and tightly packed communities of microorganisms and has an aquiferous system that increases contact time between seawater and the sponge/microbial consortium that feeds on POM, dissolved organic matter and the raw inorganic materials for chemolithotrophic sponge symbionts. The two evolutionary patterns represent different, but equally successful patterns and illustrate how associated microorganisms can potentially have substantial effects on host evolution.},

Experimental investigations demonstrate that the entire cycle from (1) temporary binding of rubble by sponges, through (2) rubble consolidation by encrusting coralline algae, to (3) colonization of consolidated rubble by corals, can be completed within 10 months. Bound rubble both adds to vertical reef growth and also provides stable substrata for colonization by corals. Corals that colonize stabilized rubble are damaged less and survive better than on unstable rubble. Rubble that is not temporarily stabilized by sponges does not become bound to the reef, because continuous movement disturbs the consolidation process, and does not provide suitable substrata for settlement and growth of corals. Sponge-mediated consolidation of rubble may increase rates of reef growth and enhance reef recovery after damage. This new role for sponges in reef growth is not obvious from examination of the internal fabric of a reef frame. Spongemediated consolidation may help to explain geographic and temporal differences in growth and morphology among shallow reefs of ramose corals.}

Natural development and long-term dynamics of these associations were observed in unmanipulated individuals and also modelled by an experiment in which branches were exchanged between neighboring sponges. The three species studied (lotrochota birotulata, Amphimedon rubens, and Aplysina fulva) share an erect branching growth form but differ in tissue and skeletal characteristics sufficiently that they are in different orders of the Class Demospongiae. Reflecting these differences, the species are demonstrated to differ from each other in their susceptibility to a variety of environmental hazards, including predation by angelfishes and trunkfishes, predation by starfish, smothering by sediment, breakage by storm waves, pulverization by storm waves, toppling by storm waves, fragment mortality, and pathogens. Although the mechanisms by which growth rate is enhanced by adhering to a heterospecific sponge are unknown, these sponges appear to be able to decrease their loss rate by adhering tightly to sponges of species that differ from them in chemistry, tissue density, and skeletal construction, thereby increasing survival of hazards to which they would succumb when growing alone.},

Although readily consumed by Oreaster, the conspicuous coral reef sponge species Lissodendoryx colombiensis Zea \& van Soest, 1986 has expanded its habitat distribution to include a seagrass (Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Konig, 1805) meadow in Belize, where individuals grow to volumes of nearly 7 l. By simple observation, L. colombiensis appears to be an inferior competitor in this system, because portions of many individuals are overgrown by seagrass sponge species. However, experimentally clustering seagrass sponges around L. colombiensis individuals deterred starfish from feeding on them, suggesting an advantage to being overgrown. Sizes of individual L. colombiensis can fluctuate widely over short time intervals, reflecting both a relatively fast growth rate and the high rate at which starfish consume this species. At the population level these fluctuations are not evident, as losses of L. colombiensis due to Oreaster are balanced by a combination of efficient recruitment, rapid regeneration and growth, and protection of portions of many individuals by the overgrowth of seagrass sponge species that are unpalatable to Oreaster. In turn, the seagrass sponges acquire stable perches on L. colombiensis individuals in this sediment-dominated habitat. Community ecology theory relating to diversity patterns in sessile organisms has focused on competition between space-requiring neighbors as the underlying process that inevitably decreases diversity unless curtailed. Sponges, with their propensity for engaging in beneficial interactions with neighbors, demand expansion of the theory to acknowledge how collaboration can increase abundance and species diversity within a community.},
