  abstract = {Coral reefs typically occur in oligotrophic waters, where tight recycling of energy and nutrients is essential in order to support their high productivity. Sponges are efficient filter feeders that host diverse and abundant microbial communities that often contain members capable of carrying out complex nutrient transformations. Consequently, sponges often act as significant sources of bioavailable forms of nitrogen and phosphorus while acting as sinks for dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, little attention has focused on variability of nutrient release by sponges and no studies have reported how abiotic conditions may impact sponge-driven changes in nutrient concentrations. Here, we show that a common Caribbean sponge, Ircinia felix, is capable of being both a source and a sink for DOC, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite (NO2x ), and phosphate (PO432). Additionally, we show that abiotic conditions, particularly ambient nutrient availability, seem to explain a significant amount of the variability (R2 range from 0.40 to 0.65). Interestingly, as ambient nutrient concentrations increased, I. felix transitioned from acting as a source to serving as a sink for all nutrient forms measured. We also found I. felix-associated bacteria exhibit a significantly higher abundance of predicted nitrogen metabolism, carbon fixation, and photosynthetic genes relative to ambient water and sediment. These results suggest that sponges play an important and dynamic role in biogeochemical cycling on reefs, particularly as human activities alter natural nutrient dynamics in coastal systems.},

One unique feature of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its ability to estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized by the mean.

In addition to the direct loss of the exploited species, the very act of fishing, particularly with mobile bottom gear, destroys habitat and ultimately results in the loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, overfishing can create trophic cascades in marine communities that cause similar declines in species richness. These effects are compounded by indirect effects on habitat that occur through removal of ecological or ecosystem engineers. Mass removal of species that restructure the architecture of habitat and thus increase its complexity or influence the biogeochemistry of sediments could have devastating effects on local biodiversity and important water\textendash sediment processes. The possible overexploitation of engineering species requires more attention because the consequences extend beyond their own decline to affect the rest of the ecosystem. This is particularly problematic in the deep ocean, where oil and gas exploration and fishing pressure are likely to increase.}

Understanding patterns of distribution of sessile epifaunal communities in seagrass meadows is an important precursor to determining the processes driving their distribution and species interactions. This study (1) identified the sponge and ascidian assemblage associated with Posidonia australis meadows and (2) determined distributional patterns of these invertebrates at a hierarchy of spatial scales in Jervis Bay, Australia. We used a fully nested design with transects distributed in the seagrass (10s m apart), two sites (100s m apart), and six locations (km apart). Within these transects, we recorded the abundance, volume, diversity and substratum used for attachment by sponges and ascidians. We encountered 20 sponge species and eight ascidian species; they were sporadically distributed in the seagrass meadows with high variability among the transects, sites and locations. A few sponge and ascidian species dominated the assemblage and were widespread across the largest spatial scale sampled. The remaining species were mostly rare and sparsely distributed. Sponges attached to a variety of substrata but most notably shells, P. australis and polychaete tubes. No obligate seagrass species were recorded although three species predominantly used P. australis as a substratum. These sponge species relying heavily on seagrass for their attachment are likely prone to disturbances impacting their host habitat. Examining the response of sessile epifauna to the degradation of their seagrass habitat remains a key challenge for the future.},

Benthic community data were analysed from videos and photographs collected using SCUBA ({$<$} 30 m) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) ({$>$} 30 m). We found significant changes in community composition with depth at all locations, suggesting that TMEs provide habitats different from those in shallower water. We consistently found that TME benthic communities were dominated by sponges, but their abundance varied significantly with depth at 3 out of 4 locations, while the morphological composition of these assemblages changed with depth at all locations. Given their particularly high abundance and morphological complexity, we suggest that sponge assemblages make an important contribution to habitat complexity in benthic TME communities.},

In this study, we standardized simulated seagrass shoot density and bed area among artificial seagrass beds in San Diego Bay, California, USA to evaluate the singular effect of seagrass bed configuration (``patchiness'') on the density and diversity of seagrass epifauna. Artificial seagrass beds all were 1 m2, but were composed of a single large patch (``continuous'' treatment), four smaller patches (``patchy'' treatment), or 16 very small patches (``very patchy'' treatment). We allowed epifauna to colonize beds for 1 month, and then sampled beds monthly over the next 3 months. Effects of seagrass bed patchiness on total epifaunal density and species-specific densities were highly variable among sampling dates, and there was no general trend for the effects of fragmentation on epifaunal densities to be positive or negative. Epifaunal diversity (measured as Simpson's index of diversity) was highest in very patchy or patchy beds on two out of the three sampling dates. Very patchy beds exhibited the highest dissimilarity in community composition in the first two sampling periods (August and September), but patchy beds exhibited the highest dissimilarity in the third sampling period (October). Our results indicate that seagrass patch configuration affects patterns of epifaunal density, diversity, and community composition in the absence of covarying bed area or structural complexity, and that patchy seagrass beds may be no less valuable as a habitat than are continuous seagrass beds. The spatial pattern employed when harvesting or planting seagrass may influence epifaunal habitat use and should be a key consideration in restoration plans.}

This note illustrates how CMP distributions can be parametrized via the mean, so that simpler and more easily interpretable mean-models can be used, such as a log-linear model. Other link functions are also available, of course. In addition to establishing attractive theoretical and asymptotic properties of the proposed model, its good finite-sample performance is exhibited through various examples and a simulation study based on real datasets. Moreover, the MATLAB routine to fit the model to data is demonstrated to be up to an order of magnitude faster than the current software to fit standard CMP models, and over two orders of magnitude faster than the recently proposed hyper-Poisson model.},

In the presence of artificial seagrass, seahorses used ``sit and wait'' foraging behavior, but in the absence of structure, seahorses actively pursued prey. Even the highest seagrass densities did not significantly reduce seahorse captures of their shrimp [Hippo\&e zostericola (Smith)] prey, in contrast to the reduced capture rates often reported for actively foraging fish predators in dense vegetation. However, capture rates were significantly reduced at low light levels, even though seahorses were able to capture small numbers of shrimp in 0 light treatments. We conclude that variation in structural complexity appears to have little effect on the foraging success of this visual ``sit and wait'' predator, while variation in light level produces significant shifts in capture rates.}

  abstract = {The recognition that all macroorganisms live in symbiotic association with microbial communities has opened up a new field in biology. Animals, plants, and algae are now considered holobionts, complex ecosystems consisting of the host, the microbiota, and the interactions among them. Accordingly, ecological concepts can be applied to understand the host-derived and microbial processes that govern the dynamics of the interactive networks within the holobiont. In marine systems, holobionts are further integrated into larger and more complex communities and ecosystems, a concept referred to as ``nested ecosystems.'' In this review, we discuss the concept of holobionts as dynamic ecosystems that interact at multiple scales and respond to environmental change. We focus on the symbiosis of sponges with their microbial communities\textemdash a symbiosis that has resulted in one of the most diverse and complex holobionts in the marine environment. In recent years, the field of sponge microbiology has remarkably advanced in terms of curated databases, standardized protocols, and information on the functions of the microbiota. Like a Russian doll, these microbial processes are translated into sponge holobiont functions that impact the surrounding ecosystem. For example, the sponge-associated microbial metabolisms, fueled by the high filtering capacity of the sponge host, substantially affect the biogeochemical cycling of key nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous. Since sponge holobionts are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic stressors that jeopardize the stability of the holobiont ecosystem, we discuss the link between environmental perturbations, dysbiosis, and sponge diseases. Experimental studies suggest that the microbial community composition is tightly linked to holobiont health, but whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of holobiont collapse remains unresolved. Moreover, the potential role of the microbiome in mediating the capacity for holobionts to acclimate and adapt to environmental change is unknown. Future studies should aim to identify the mechanisms underlying holobiont dynamics at multiple scales, from the microbiome to the ecosystem, and develop management strategies to preserve the key functions provided by the sponge holobiont in our present and future oceans.}

This dichotomy has previously been suggested to correlate with morphological differences, with HMA species having a denser mesohyl and a more complex aquiferous systems composed of longer and narrower water canals that should necessitate slower seawater filtration rates. We measured mesohyl density for a variety of HMA and LMA sponges in the Florida Keys, and seawater pumping rates for a select group of these sponges using an in situ dye technique. HMA sponges were substantially denser than LMA species, and had per unit volume pumping rates 52-94\% slower than the LMA sponges. These density and pumping rate differences suggest that evolutionary differences between HMA and LMA species may have resulted in profound morphological and physiological differences between the two groups. The LMA sponge body plan moves large quantities of water through their porous tissues allowing them to rapidly acquire the small particulate organic matter (POM) that supplies the majority of their nutritional needs. In contrast, the HMA sponge body plan is suited to host large and tightly packed communities of microorganisms and has an aquiferous system that increases contact time between seawater and the sponge/microbial consortium that feeds on POM, dissolved organic matter and the raw inorganic materials for chemolithotrophic sponge symbionts. The two evolutionary patterns represent different, but equally successful patterns and illustrate how associated microorganisms can potentially have substantial effects on host evolution.},

  abstract = {Caribbean sponge species typical of coral reefs are generally inhibited from living in seagrass meadows by their vulnerability to predation by the large starfish Oreaster reticulatus (Linnaeus 1758). Although readily consumed by Oreaster, the conspicuous coral reef sponge species Lissodendoryx colombiensis Zea \& van Soest, 1986 has expanded its habitat distribution to include a seagrass (Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Konig, 1805) meadow in Belize, where individuals grow to volumes of nearly 7 l. By simple observation, L. colombiensis appears to be an inferior competitor in this system, because portions of many individuals are overgrown by seagrass sponge species. However, experimentally clustering seagrass sponges around L. colombiensis individuals deterred starfish from feeding on them, suggesting an advantage to being overgrown. Sizes of individual L. colombiensis can fluctuate widely over short time intervals, reflecting both a relatively fast growth rate and the high rate at which starfish consume this species. At the population level these fluctuations are not evident, as losses of L. colombiensis due to Oreaster are balanced by a combination of efficient recruitment, rapid regeneration and growth, and protection of portions of many individuals by the overgrowth of seagrass sponge species that are unpalatable to Oreaster. In turn, the seagrass sponges acquire stable perches on L. colombiensis individuals in this sediment-dominated habitat. Community ecology theory relating to diversity patterns in sessile organisms has focused on competition between space-requiring neighbors as the underlying process that inevitably decreases diversity unless curtailed. Sponges, with their propensity for engaging in beneficial interactions with neighbors, demand expansion of the theory to acknowledge how collaboration can increase abundance and species diversity within a community.},

  abstract = {Intimate associations among individuals of three common species of Caribbean coral reef sponges can be mutually beneficial. Both growth rate and survival are enhanced when heterospecific sponges adhere to each other, as demonstrated by experiments in which sponges of the same size and genotype were grown (1) in intimate association with conspecific vs. heterospecific sponges, (2) alone vs. in intimate association with conspecific sponges, and (3) alone on the primary substratum vs. attached to an intact branch of a conspecific or heterospecific sponge. Natural development and long-term dynamics of these associations were observed in unmanipulated individuals and also modelled by an experiment in which branches were exchanged between neighboring sponges. The three species studied (lotrochota birotulata, Amphimedon rubens, and Aplysina fulva) share an erect branching growth form but differ in tissue and skeletal characteristics sufficiently that they are in different orders of the Class Demospongiae. Reflecting these differences, the species are demonstrated to differ from each other in their susceptibility to a variety of environmental hazards, including predation by angelfishes and trunkfishes, predation by starfish, smothering by sediment, breakage by storm waves, pulverization by storm waves, toppling by storm waves, fragment mortality, and pathogens. Although the mechanisms by which growth rate is enhanced by adhering to a heterospecific sponge are unknown, these sponges appear to be able to decrease their loss rate by adhering tightly to sponges of species that differ from them in chemistry, tissue density, and skeletal construction, thereby increasing survival of hazards to which they would succumb when growing alone.},

  abstract = {Some sponge species that live in crevices in the reef frame appear to be restricted to their cryptic habitat by predation. When cryptic sponges were excavated, on Guigalotupo reef. San Bias, Panama, exposing them to potential predators, they were eaten by fishes that are generally considered to be herbivores, primarily parrot-fishes of the genus Sparisoma: S. aurofrenatum (Cuvier \& Valenciennes), S. viride (Bonnaterre), and S. aurofrenatum (Bloch \& Schneider). Of the 9150 bites observed to be taken by these species during paired (i.e., with sponges versus without sponges) trials conducted in defined feeding areas during 1986, 1987, and 1988, 72\% (i.e. 6581 bites) were on cryptic sponges, even though these were only offered during half of the total observation time and never constituted more than 7\% of the cover of the feeding observation areas. Individual parrotfish returned over and over to take bites of the exposed cryptic sponges until they were entirely consumed. They vigorously chased each other away from the sponges, but exhibited no such defense of their usual algal foods. A total of 18 sponge species were tested. Of the cryptic and semi-cryptic sponge species tested, only one of six was rejected by the parrotfish. Two of these six sponge species were consistently consumed entirely, and two were consumed entirely whenever their surfaces were sliced off with a razor blade, demonstrating that these sponges concentrate defenses against predators in their surfaces. One semi-cryptic species and one semi-exposed species were fed upon, but not entirely consumed. By contrast, 11 of 12 of the exposed and semi-exposed species were rejected. Cryptic sponges grew out of their cavities in the reef only when protected by seasonally thick mats of macroalgae or by cages that excluded fish.},
