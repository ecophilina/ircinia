# Introduction  

All habitats on earth are influenced by ecosystem engineers. 
Ecosystem engineers [*sensu* @Jones1994] are organisms that directly or indirectly change the flow of resources (excluding their own living or dead tissue) to other species, through changes in an ecosystem’s biotic or abiotic materials. 
Because of this interaction, ecosystem engineers can create, change, or destroy entire habitats. 
Ecosystem engineers can have significant effects on the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within their community [@Jones1994]. 
Thus, it is important that we study ecosystem engineer’s cascading effects on associated communities, especially because of the current major environmental problems, like the overexploitation of marine ecosystem engineers [@Coleman2002]. \par

There are two types of ecosystem engineers: autogenic and allogenic. 
Autogenic engineers alter the environment by their physical structures [@Jones1994]. 
For example, crustose coralline algae on coral reefs attenuate wave energy with their hard, calcareous structure which protects the corals from damage by wave energy [@Anderson1992]. 
This function provides stabilization to the coral reefs, which are foundation species [*sensu* @Dayton1972 as refined by @Bruno2001], a species that provides habitat and alters abiotic conditions with net positive effects on diversity, distribution, and abundance of other organisms [@Altieri 2014]. 
Additionally, an allogenic engineer alters the environment by changing living or non-living materials from one physical state to another [@Jones1994]. 
Again, crustose coralline algae secretes a chemical that binds suspended sediment together forming calcareous mounds on the benthos [@Anderson1992; @Goreau1963]. 
The calcareous mounds act as a hard substrate in which numerous organisms need to settle and survive [@Goreau1963]. 
Evidently, an organism can be both an autogenic and allogenic ecosystem engineer. 
In addition, the crustose coralline algae exemplifies the potential effects that ecosystem engineers have on foundation species and associated communities. \par

Seagrass beds are foundation species and important coastal ecosystems worldwide; they provide habitat [@James1994], stabilize sediments [@Folmer2012], attenuate wave energy [@Fonseca1992], and are important locations for nutrient cycling [@Hemminga1991]. 
Many studies have shown how seagrass beds affect their dependent communities [@Healey2004; @Hori2009]. 
However, the effects that some ecosystem engineers, specifically marine sponges, have on seagrass communities are underrepresented and underappreciated in marine systems [@Bell2008]. \par 

Marine sponges can be considered ecosystem engineers because they retain and recycle energy and nutrients, act as microhabitats, and facilitate primary production [@Archer2021; @Bell2008]. 
A prime example is *Ircinia felix*, a high microbial abundant sponge common to reefs and seagrass beds throughout the sub-tropical Atlantic and Caribbean [@Diaz2005; @Loh2014]. 
This sponge, like many found in The Bahamas, hosts a dense and diverse microbiome [@Weisz2008] which facilitates complex nutrient transformations, having indirect effects on ambient nutrient and energy availability [@Archer2017]. 
Like the crustose coralline algae, *Irciania felix* can act as both an autogenic and allogenic ecosystem engineer. 
Because sponges are being threatened by anthropogenic stressors that may change the composition and stability of sponge’s microbiome, it is important that we study how the ecosystem engineers, sponges, affect organisms within their community in a low-impact environment [@Pita2018].  
Furthermore, Archer et al. (2021) describes the effects of *Ircinia felix* on seagrass beds (foundation species)in a low-impact environment.  
Our goal is to further Archer et al.’s [2021] findings on the ecosystem engineer [*Ircinia felix*] to the fish and macroinvertebrate community level. \par

While sponges of all sizes are common in seagrass beds, larger sponges are likely to have a stronger influence on their environment due to both their size and the volume of water they filter. 
In the present study, we investigated the impact of a moderately large sponge, [*Ircinia felix*], on seagrass bed associated communities. 
Using a 1.5 yr field-based experiment, we examined how sponge presence influenced fish and invertebrate species richness, abundance, and turnover. 
Because *Ircinia felix* was found to enhance primary producers in seagrass beds [@Archer2021] we hypothesize that the ecosystem engineer will enhance the community as well. 
Specifically, we hypothesize that seagrass beds with *Ircinia felix* will have higher species richness and abundance after one year than seagrass beds without *Ircinia felix* present. 
We also hypothesize that species turnover in treatments with *Ircinia felix* will be maintained over time while treatments without will have more disappearance and less appearance of new species over time. \par

# Methods  

## Study site and experimental design  
 
This study was conducted in a continuous subtidal seagrass bed (1.1 m low tide depth) on Southern Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas (26.02610 N, 77.37408 W). 
Depth, temperature, and salinity were consistent across the seagrass bed.
Within the seagrass bed, fifteen 5 x 5 m plots were delineated on June 9, 2013 by placing wooden stakes at the corners and center of each plot. 
All plots were separated >2 m. 
The fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities as well as all explanatory variables (see below) were sampled once before and again at 1 and 12 months after the treatments were established. 
**THE TEXT BELOW WAS COPIED DIRECTLY FROM THE FIRST MANUSCRIPT MUST BE REWORDED** 
Each of the 15 plots were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: control (n=5), structure (n=5), or sponge (n=5; Fig. S1). 
Control plots were not manipulated.
A polypropylene model of a sponge was placed inside a cage at the center of each structure plot.
A single living sponge (*I. felix*, average volume ± standard deviation, 2.5 ± 0.75 L) was placed inside a cage in the center of each sponge plot.
Live sponges were replaced as needed with a total of 3 individual sponge replacements, all occurring within the first month of the experiment.\par 

## Community Structure Response Variables  
The response of the fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities were monitored throughout the course of the experiment. 
The fish community was quantified by observing the plot for 5 minutes, all fish observed within the plot during the observation period were recorded. 
For analysis small silvery pelagic fishes which form large schools (e.g. fishes in the families Atherinopsidae and Clupeidae) were excluded following @peters2015. 
The macroinvertebrate community were quantified within a 3 m x 1 m band extending from the center of the plot. 
All macroinvertebrates were identified to genus and recorded. 
If identification was not possible in situ a representative sample was photographed and subsequently collected.\par

## Statistical Analyses
Three sampling events occured in the Summer: one in June (0 months into the experiment) and two in July (1 and 12 months into the experiment). The sampling events were grouped by years into the experiment for temporal examination.

Univariate analyses
Univariate analyses were performed on three community groupings: fish, non-clonal invertebrates, and clonal invertebrates. All groupings were fit with a Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution parametrized via the mean and a log link (Huang 2017). Forward model selection was performed to determine the model explaining the most variance using corrected Akaike Infromation Criterion scores (AICc). The model with the lowest AICc value for species richness of each community grouping was reviewed in the final analyses.

Taxa Turnover
To visualize changes in taxa richness over time (i.e. taxa gained or lost relative to the total number of taxa observed across the two sampling events in July), we used the turnover function in "codyn" package.

***This probably needs modifying (or remaking?) to include only summer sampling periods, the plots with their assigned treatment, and the outline of the total area in which inverts, algae, and sea grass density were sampled. Also, we may want to remove the notes about fish and inverts from the version of this to go in the productivity manuscript.***
