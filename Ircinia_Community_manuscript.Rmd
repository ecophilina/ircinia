# Introduction 

Ecosystem engineers [*sensu* @Jones1994] are organisms that impact an ecosystem's structure and function more so than their abundance would suggest.
They can create or change entire habitats and have significant effects on the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within their community, which is important to preserve in a changing world [@Jones1994]. 
Jones (1994) coined the term "ecosystem engineer" almost 30 years ago, however, we still lack a thorough understanding of which species fulfill this role in many systems [@Byers2006].
Even more so, we lack an understanding of the multitude of ecosystem engineers residing in one habitat, and their potential to affect the ecosystem biodiversity on their own and/or together. \par 

Seagrasses are well-known, important ecosystem engineers that form beds supporting a wide range of biodiversity[@Hori2009]. 
They provide shelter[@James1994] to numerous species and at multiple life stages [@Nakamura2012], act as a food source [@Vincente1980], and play a key role in nutrient cycling [@Hemminga1991].
Marine sponges are among the many organisms seagrass beds support, and have the potential to act as ecosystem engineers within these systems. \par

Marine sponges have been shown to add to the structural complexity of a habitat by altering local-scale water flow [@Bell2008], stabilizing substrate [@Wulff1984], and acting as settlement substrate for a range of sessile organisms [@Bell2008].
They act as a source of bioavailable forms of phosphorus and nitrogen in seagrass beds under oligotrophic conditions [@Archer2017]
In addition, some marine sponges have numerous microbes and macrofauna living within them[@Wulff2996; @Taylor2007; @Bell2003] and can provide camouflage and protection to other prey organisms [@McClay1983; @Martin1992]. 
Finally, a marine sponge has also been shown to facilitate primary production in low-impact, sub-tropical seagrass beds [@Archer2021],which would pose suitable conditions for enhancing biodiversity. \par

The multiple interactions marine sponges have with other fauna and their ability to transform nutrients alludes to their potential to significantly affect the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within their community. 
However, the effects of marine sponges on seagrass communities have long been underrepresented and underappreciated in marine systems [@Bell2008]. 
To the best of our knowledge, no research has investigated the affects of a marine sponge on the biodiversity in seagrass beds. 
Because marine sponges are being threatened by anthropogenic stressors that may change the composition and stability of the sponge's microbiome, it is important that we study this ecosystem engineers' affect on the community in a low-impact environment [@Pita2018].
Therefore, we investigated the affects of sponge presence on biodiversity within seagrass ecosystems.
Furthermore, if the presence of a marine sponge did affect biodiversity in seagrass beds, then we further explored if the affect is due to the enhancement to the primary producers (i.e. other ecosystem engineers within the system) as Archer et al. [2021] has shown, the presence of the sponge alone, or a combination of both. \par


In the present study, we investigated the impact of a moderately large sponge, [*Ircinia felix*], on seagrass bed associated communities. 
Using a 1.5 yr field-based experiment, we examined how sponge presence influenced fish and invertebrate species richness, abundance, turnover, and community compositional vectors. 
Because *I. felix* was found to affect primary producers in seagrass beds [@Archer2021], we hypothesize that the ecosystem engineer will affect the community as well. 
Specifically, we predict seagrass beds with *I. felix* will have higher species richness and abundance over time than seagrass beds without *Ircinia felix* present. 
We also hypothesize that species turnover in treatments with *I. felix* will have a fewer losses and more gains in the number of species over time when compared to treatments without the sponge present.
Finally, we predict that the presence of *I.felix* will change the community composition over time.\par

# Methods  

## Study site and experimental design  
 
This study was conducted in a continuous subtidal seagrass bed (1.1 m low tide depth) on Southern Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas (26.02610 N, 77.37408 W). 
Depth, temperature, and salinity were consistent across the seagrass bed.
Within the seagrass bed, fifteen 5 x 5 m plots were delineated on June 9, 2013 by placing wooden stakes at the corners and center of each plot. 
All plots were separated >2 m. 
The fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities, as well as all explanatory variables (see below), were sampled once before the beginning of the experiment and again at 1 and 12 months after the treatments were established. 
Control (n=5), structure (n=5), and sponge (n=5) treatments were randomly assigned to plots. 
The control plots were unaltered ~~sections within the seagrass bed~~.
The structure treatment had ~~, at the center of each plot, ~~a polypropylene model of a sponge *at the center of each plot*~~within a cage to keep the model stationary~~.
At the center of each sponge treatment plot, we placed one living sponge (*I. felix*, average volume ± standard deviation, 2.5 ± 0.75 L).
Both live and model sponges were placed within a cage to keep the sponge stationary.
~~It was only within the first month of the experiment that 3~~ *Three live sponges were replaced as they showed signs of dying within the first month of the experiment.
Live sponges were monitored throughout the rest of the experiment but no additional replacements were necessary* ~~live sponges needed to and were replaced.~~ \par
**Likely need to cite the first paper and mention that effects on primary production were assessed in it?** 
*yes we should, but we can do it down where we talk about how the predictor variables were measured*

## Community Assessment

The response of the fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities were monitored throughout the course of the experiment.
Three sampling events occured in the summer: one in June (0 months into the experiment) and two in July (1 and 12 months into the experiment).
These latter experimental sampling times were designated as year 1 and year 2 of the experiment, respectively.
On each occasion, all fish observed within each plot during a 5 min observation period were counted and recorded.
However, small silvery pelagic fishes which form large schools (e.g. fishes in the families Atherinopsidae and Clupeidae) were excluded from analyses following [@peters2015].
The macroinvertebrate community were quantified within a 3 m x 1 m band extending from the center of the plot.
All macroinvertebrates were identified to genus and recorded.
If identification was not possible *in situ*, a representative sample was photographed and subsequently collected.
For clonal tunicates an accurate count of individuals was not feasible; therefore species of tunicate were assessed simply as present/absent and analyzed separately from non-clonal invertebrates.\par

## Predictor variables
*need to add text here describing which predictor variables we included, refer the reader to our previous paper, and give a brief description of how each was calculated* 

## Statistical Analyses

#Univariate analysis

Univariate analyses were performed on three community groups: fish, non-clonal invertebrates, and clonal invertebrates. 
The groups were assessed for differences among treatment types using a generalized linear mixed model, with the sponge treatment plots as the reference level.*This is where the lack of set-up about seagrass productivity/structure vs sponge presence as competing hypotheses makes the manuscript a bit tricky*
All groups were fit with a Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution performed through the glmmTMB package and parametrized via the mean and a log link [@brooks2017; @Huan2017].
We chose candidate model configurations that represented different biological hypotheses and used the package AICcmodavg [@Mazerolle2020] to create a model selection tables based on Akaike Infromation Criterion scores (AICc). *Same concept different comment. These hypotheses need to be set up and clearly defined by the end of the intro When these hypotheses are clearly articulated and instroduced we can explicitly state which model tested which hypothesis. Then this section from here on out becomes much easier to write and interpret*
We used treatment, seagrass productivity, seagrass structure, and algal abundance as explanatory variables.
Plot (as a random variable) and sampling event were always included in the model as explanatory variables. 
When treatment and sampling event were both in a model, there was an interaction between the two. 
The model with the lowest AICc value was selected in the final analyses, however, models that were within two delta AICc's away from this model was further analyzed for thoroughness (see discussion and supplement).\par

# Taxa Turnover

To visualize changes in taxa richness over time (i.e. taxa gained or lost relative to the total number of taxa observed across the two sampling events in July), we used the turnover function in codyn package [@Hallett2020] to visualize the proportion of species lost by the proportion of species gained. Taxa turnover was performed on the fish, non-clonal invertebrate, and clonal invertebrate community data for each plot and compared among treatments at 1 and 12 months into the experiment.\par

# Compositional Vectors

To assess community changes in treatments across time (from 0 to 12 months into the experiment), compositional vectors were calculated for each plot in the fish, non-clonal invertebrate, and clonal invertebrate communities.
First, for each type of community data, a Hellinger's transformation was performed followed by an RDA using the "vegan" package(@oksanen2020).
The scores from the RDA analysis were then used to calculate a vector length and angle for each plot as per Mccune. 
An analysis of variance was performed on each community's vector length and angle to test significant difference in treatments with real as the reference using the "stats" package.
When significance occurred, a post-hoc analysis via a Tukey test was then performed to look at the differences in vector length and angle among treatments also in the "stats" package (@RCoreTeam2021).
For visual purposed, all vectors were standardized to the same initial position and then plotted across species space to show how much a community changed over time (i.e. vector length) and in which direction across species space the community shifted towards (i.e. vector angle).\par

Throughout the results, we present effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals rather than test statistics and p-values. All test statistics and p-values can be found in the supplemental material.\par

```

##Fish  
  

In the sponge treatment, fish species richness and abundance increased at 1 and 12 months into the experiment (species richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,4)`; $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,5)`; species abundance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,4)`; $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,5)` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plot)).
In the structure treatment, species richness and abundance increased at 1 month and decreased at 12 months, but neither changes were significant ( Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plot)).
After 1 and 12 months into the experiment, species richness and abundance in control plots decreased, though the change was only significant after 12 months (species richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,8)`; species abundance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,8)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plot)).\par

##Non-clonal Invertebrates  

In the sponge treatment, non-clonal invertebrate species richness and abundance significantly increased at 1 and 12 months into the experiment (species richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,4)`; $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,5)`; species abundance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,4)`; $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,5)` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plot)).
In the structure treatment, species richness and abundance  decrease at 1 and 12 months into the experiment, though species richness at 1 month was not significant (species richness: 12 months- $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,9)`; species abundance: 1 month- $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,7)`; 12 months- $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,9)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plot)).
At 1 month into the experiment, species richness increased while species abundance decreased in control plots, though neither changes were significant( Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plot)).
Then, at 12 months into the experiment, both species richness and abundance in control plots decreased, but only species abundance was significant ( $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,8)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plot)).\par

##Clonal Invertebrates  

There were no significant differences between treatments for species richness of clonal invertebrates ( Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)). Species abundance could not be analyzed because an accurate count of individuals was not feasible.\par


##Species Turnover  

When comparing species turnover from 1 month to 12 months in sponge treatment plots, the overall turnover rates show an increase in species gained for fish and non-clonal invertebrates, which parallels the results from the univariate analysis (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots).
In structure and control plots there appears to be a decrease in species gained and increase in species lost for both fish and non-clonal invertebrates, also supporting the results from th univariate analyses (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots). \par

For clonal invertebrates, species turnover from 1 to 12 months did not show differences in treatment plots for species gained or lost (Fig. S2). 
The lack of differences in species turnover among treatments coincides with lack of change in species richness at 1 on 12 months into the experiment. \par

## Compositional Vectors

By 12 months into the experiment, the fish communities differed significantly by treatment for both vector length and angle, meaning they differed in the how much they changed over time and in direction of change across species space (vector length:  F~`r aov.df2(fish.vl.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(fish.vl.aov.sum,1)`; vector angle: F~`r aov.df2(fish.angle.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(fish.angle.aov.sum,1)`). 
The post-hoc analysis of vector lengths showed a significant difference in how much the fish communities changed over time between the control and sponge treatments and between the structure and sponge treatments, with control and structure both having less change in community over time when compared to the sponge treatment plots (control-sponge: `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,1)` ; structure-sponge `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,2)`). 
However, there was no difference in the amount of change in the fish community between structure and control treatments (`r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,3)`). 
The post-hoc analysis of the vector angles showed no significant difference in the direction in which the fish communities shifted across species space between the control and sponge treatments, which may be due to the small change in the control plot communities over time (control-sponge: `r tukey.res(fish.angle.aov.tuk,1)` ; Fig. \@ref(fig:vector-plots)`). 
Contrastingly, there were differences in the direction of the communities across species space between the structure and sponge as well as between the structure and control, with structure plots having less change in communities across species space than both sponge or control (structure-sponge: `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,2)` ; structure-control `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,3)`). \par

By 12 months into the experiment, the non-clonal invertebrate communities per plot had no differences across treatments for vector length and angle, meaning they did not differ in the amount of change over time nor in direction of change across species space (vector length:  F~`r aov.df2(inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`; vector angle: F~`r aov.df2(inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`). 
Because there were no statistical differences, post-hoc analysis was not performed on the non-clonal invertebrates. \par

Like the non-clonal invertebrates, the clonal invertebrate communities did not differ among treatments in the amount of change over time nor in the direction of change across species space (vector length:  F~`r aov.df2(col.inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(col.inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`; vector angle: F~`r aov.df2(col.inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(col.inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`). 
Thus, no post-hoc analysis was performed on this group. \par

# Discussion  

Ecosystem engineers can affect many aspects of an ecosystem including habitat structure, resource availability and location, and community structure and dynamics [@Jones1994; @Anderson1992; @Byers2006].
Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first in situ experiment to test the effects of the presence of *I. felix* on species richness, abundance, species turnover, and community compositional vectors as an ecosystem engineer in a subtropical seagrass ecosystem over a 1.5 year experiment.
We found that, in fish and non-clonal invertebrates, species richness and abundance increased  after 1 month and 1 year in the presence of *I. felix* while decreasing or remaining the same without the sponge presence in seagrass ecosystems. \par

This study presents an ecosystem engineer that can affect community structure in terms of species richness, abundance, and turnover, but the mechanism of this interaction is unclear.
The change in community structure could be due to the indirect effects of *I. felix* releasing bioavailable forms of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment [@Southwell2008; Archer2017] which has been shown to increase primary production in seagrass beds [@Archer2021].
This increase in primary producers could bring in more organisms that use them for food and shelter. 
However, it is possible that *I. felix* acts as a food source in itself, attracting specific species that eat sponges [@Wulff1997].
It is important to note that, for this experiment, the *I. felix* sponge within the plots were encased in a cage, which would restrict fish and macroinvertebrates from consuming it.
More research is still needed to show the exact mechanism for how this ecosystem engineer changes the community structure in seagrass ecosystems. \par

Two major fishes observed in treatments with *I. felix* present were grunts and damselfish.
The grunts and damselfish were highly abundant in sponge treatments and less in control and stucture control.
Other research has shown grunts to be sponge associated and they are associated because….
It is possible the grunts in our experiment were highly abundant in sponge treatments because …, causing a significant shift in the fish community.
However, more researcher on sponge-grunt interactions is needed to fully understand this mechanism.\par

When selecting the statistical model that would explain the most variance, there were a few models that were not >2 delta aicc away from top model to our treatment model for invertebrate species richness and abundance.
Algal community, seagrass structure, and seagrass productivity, individually, were all close top models to treatment.
However, treatment always had the lowest AIC value and therefore the model we chose for analysis.
We further explored those models (which can be found in the supplement) to find that they showed similar results of species richness and abundance being higher in sponge treatments after 1 and 12 months into the experiment with no change or decrease in species richness and abundance in control and structure  plots.
This provides further support to our findings that the ecosystem engineer, I felix, has cascading effects on seagrass communities. \par

<!-- Many sponges have been shown to act as a habitat structure to invertebrates. -->
<!-- Specifically, _____ found invertebrates using a sponge as a habitat and structure to hide from predators. -->
<!-- However, we did not find these species present in our experiment. -->
<!-- More research should be performed on I. felix as a habitat structure. \par -->

	It is important to understand ecosystem engineers (e.g. *I. felix*) effects on the organisms around them because it can result in changes in the community structure and dynamics, therefore indirectly influencing ecosystem functions and services provided by the community.
We studied the effect of the presence of an ecosystem engineer, *I felix*, on species richness, abundance, and turnover in low impact seagrass beds and found that sponge presence can increase species richness and abundance and maintain turnover rates.
Thus, this study is another in situ example of how one organism, an ecosystem engineer, can affect an entire community.
Additional research is needed to find the mechanism through which *I. felix* influences seagrass bed community, and if the influence direction changes in impacted systems. \par
