# Introduction 

Ecosystem engineers [*sensu* @Jones1994] are organisms that impact an ecosystem's structure and function more so than their abundance would suggest.
They can create, change, or destroy entire habitats and have significant effects on the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within their community [@Jones1994].
Consequently, it is important that we study ecosystem engineer’s cascading effects on associated communities, especially due to the overexploitation of many marine ecosystem engineers [@Coleman2002]. 
The ecosystem engineering concept is a relatively new term and, thus, researchers are still working towards identifying which species are acting as ecosystem engineers in many systems[Byers2006]. \par

Seagrasses, important habitat-forming (foundation) species, support a wide range of biodiversity[@Hori2009]. 
This is because they provide shelter[@James1994] to numerous species and at multiple life stages [@Nakamura2012], act as a food source [@Vincente1980], play a key role in nutrient cycling [@Hemminga1991], etc.
Of the many organisms seagrass beds support are sponges, which have the potential to act as ecosystem engineers within these systems.
However, the effects of marine sponges on seagrass communities have long been underrepresented and underappreciated in marine systems [@Bell2008]. 
We believe that marine sponges have the potential to act as ecosystem engineers in seagrass beds for several reasons. \par

One of the main contributions by marine sponges that deem them ecosystem engineers is their addition to the structural complexity of seagrass habitats. 
Structural complexity of a habitat, or rugosity, is one of the main habitat characteristics influencing biodiversity in fish and invertebrates in subtropical marine systems, including seagrass beds [Gratwicke & Speight 2005; Fuchs 2013].
Through the addition of structural complexity, sponges have been shown to alter local-scale water flow[@Bell2008] and stabilize substrate [@Wulff1984], alleviating some of the physical pressures put on seagrass beds and associated fauna.
Not only can they alleviate abiotic stressors, the increased structural complexity can provide settlement substrate, creating more opportunities for a range of sessile organisms [@Bell2008].
These characteristics exemplify how marine sponges in seagrass systems can be considered autogenic ecosystem engineers, altering the environment by their physical structure [@Jones1994] \par

Marine sponges also play a role in bento-pelagic coupling in seagrass systems. 
Archer et al [2017] showed that the marine sponge, *Ircinia felix*, acted as a source of bioavailable forms of phosphorus and nitrogen on seagrass beds under oligotrophic conditions.
This marine sponge has also been shown to facilitate primary production in low-impact, sub-tropical seagrass beds [@Archer2021], in turn, creating more organic matter to support microbes and macrofauna.
In addition, some marine sponges feed on microscopic plankton and have high bacterial diversity living within them, creating the opportunity for more organisms to be infiltrated into higher trophic levels within seagrass systems [@Bell2003].
These characteristics portray marine sponges in seagrass systems as allogenic ecosystem engineers, altering the environment by changing living or non-living materials from one physical state to another [@Jones1994]  \par

Lastly, marine sponge research has shown several associations/interactions with other organisms that could deem them ecosystem engineers and, overall, affecting the diversity of seagrass communities.
Marine sponges act as organismal camouflage and provide protection from potential predators, indirectly increasing the survival rates of a wide variety of organisms [@McClay1983; @Martin1992]. 
Many studies have shown marine sponges provide a microhabitat for microbes and macrofauna, providing potential to host a highly biodiverse community [@Wulff2996; @Taylor2007; @Bell2003].
The multiple interactions marine sponges have with other organisms and their abilitiy to transform nutrients  alludes to their ability to significantly affect the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within their community. \par

Through the wide variety of ecosystem functions by marine sponges, as ecosystem engineers in seagrass systems, we predict a single sponge has the potential to affect an entire community. 
A prime example is *I. felix*, a high microbial abundant sponge common to reefs and seagrass beds throughout the sub-tropical Atlantic and Caribbean [@Diaz2005; @Loh2014]. 
This sponge, like many found in The Bahamas, hosts a dense and diverse microbiome [@Weisz2008] which facilitates complex nutrient transformations, having indirect effects on ambient nutrient and energy availability [@Archer2017]. 
*I. felix* is a moderately large sponge, which is likely to influence the surrounding environment because of their size and filtration rates.
Because marine sponges are being threatened by anthropogenic stressors that may change the composition and stability of the sponge's microbiome, it is important that we study how these ecosystem engineers affect organisms within their community in a low-impact environment [@Pita2018].  
Our goal is to further Archer et al.’s [2021] findings by viewing *I. felix* as an ecosystem engineer in seagrass ecosystems, and how it affects the fish and macroinvertebrate community. \par

In the present study, we investigated the impact of a moderately large sponge, [*I.felix*], on seagrass bed associated communities. 
Using a 1.5 yr field-based experiment, we examined how sponge presence influenced fish and invertebrate species richness, abundance, and turnover. 
Because *I. felix* was found to enhance primary producers in seagrass beds [@Archer2021] we hypothesize that the ecosystem engineer will enhance the community as well. 
Specifically, we hypothesize that seagrass beds with *I. felix* will have higher species richness and abundance after one year than seagrass beds without *Ircinia felix* present. 
We also hypothesize that species turnover in treatments with *I. felix* will have a greater appearance of species over time, while treatments without a sponge will have more species disappear over time. \par


# Methods  

## Study site and experimental design  
 
This study was conducted in a continuous subtidal seagrass bed (1.1 m low tide depth) on Southern Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas (26.02610 N, 77.37408 W). 
Depth, temperature, and salinity were consistent across the seagrass bed.
Within the seagrass bed, fifteen 5 x 5 m plots were delineated on June 9, 2013 by placing wooden stakes at the corners and center of each plot. 
All plots were separated >2 m. 
The fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities, as well as all explanatory variables (see below), were sampled once before the beginning of the experiment and again at 1 and 12 months after the treatments were established. 
Control (n=5), structure (n=5), and sponge (n=5) treatments were randomly assigned to plots. 
The control plots were unaltered sections within the seagrass bed.
The structure treatment had, at the center of each plot, a polypropylene model of a sponge within a cage to keep the model stationary.
At the center of each sponge treatment plot, we placed one living sponge (*I. felix*, average volume ± standard deviation, 2.5 ± 0.75 L) within a cage to keep the sponge stationary.
Only within the first month of the experiment, 3 live sponges needed to be and were replaced. \par
**Likely need to cite the first paper and mention that effects on primary production were assessed in it?** 

## Community Assessment

The response of the fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities were monitored throughout the course of the experiment. 
Three sampling events occured in the summer: one in June (0 months into the experiment) and two in July (1 and 12 months into the experiment). 
These latter experimental sampling times were designated as year 1 and year 2 of the experiment, respectively.
On each occassion, all fish observed within each plot during a 5 min observation period were counted and recorded. 
However, small silvery pelagic fishes which form large schools (e.g. fishes in the families Atherinopsidae and Clupeidae) were excluded from analyses following @peters2015. 
The macroinvertebrate community were quantified within a 3 m x 1 m band extending from the center of the plot. 
All macroinvertebrates were identified to genus and recorded. 
If identification was not possible in situ a representative sample was photographed and subsequently collected.
For clonal tunicates an accurate count of individuals was not feasible; therefore species of tunicate were assessed simply as present/absent and analyzed separately from non-clonal invertebrates.\par 


## Statistical Analyses

Univariate analyses were performed on three community groupings: fish, non-clonal invertebrates, and clonal invertebrates. 
All groupings were fit with a Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution performed through the glmmTMB package and parametrized via the mean and a log link [@brooks2017; @Huan2017].
We chose candidate model configurations that represented different biological hypotheses and used the package AICcmodavg [@Mazerolle2020] to create a model selection table based on Akaike Infromation Criterion scores (AICc). 
We used treatment, seagrass productivity, seagrass structure, and algal abundance as explanatory variables with plot as a random variable and sampling event always included in the model. 
When treatment and sampling event were in a model, there was an interaction between the two. 
The model with the lowest AICc value was selected in the final analyses, however, models that were within two delta AICc's away from this model was further analyzed for thoroughness (see discussion).

Taxa Turnover
To visualize changes in taxa richness over time (i.e. taxa gained or lost relative to the total number of taxa observed across the two sampling events in July), we used the turnover function in codyn package [@Hallett2020].

Compositional Vectors
In order to assess community changes among the three treatment groups, we created compositional vectors, where each treatment plot was represented as a single vector. 
We separating analyzed differences in compositional vector's direction and length across species space. 
To analyze vector length (differences in rate of change across species space) we used an ANOVA to test for differences among treatments, followed by a Post-Hoc analysis using a Tukey test through the ____ package. 
The same analysis was performed for vector angle (differences in directional change across species space. 
These tests were performed for each community: fish, non-clonal invertebrates, and clonal invertebrates. 
For visual purposes, all vectors were translated to a common origin to simultaneously view the rate of change in both direction and rate across species space.

##Univariate Results
##Fish
```{r fish.uni , include=FALSE}
source("scripts_comm/05_fish_univariate_poisson.R")
```  

In the sponge treatment, fish species richness and abundance increased at 1 and 12 months into the experiment (species richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,4)`; $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,5)`; species abundance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,4)`; $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,5)` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:fishab)).
In the structure treatment, species richness and abundance increased at 1 month and decreased at 12 months, but neither changes were significant ( Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:fishab)).
After 1 and 12 months into the experiment, species richness and abundance in control plots decreased, though the change was only significant after 12 months (species richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,8)`; species abundance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,8)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:fishab)).

##Non-clonal Invertebrates
```{r inv.uni , include=FALSE}
source("scripts_comm/04_invert_univariate_poisson.R")
```  

In the sponge treatment, non-clonal invertebrate species richness and abundance significantly increased at 1 and 12 months into the experiment (species richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,4)`; $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,5)`; species abundance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,4)`; $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,5)` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:invab)).
In the structure treatment, species richness and abundance  decrease at 1 and 12 months into the experiment, though species richness at 1 month was not significant (species richness: 12 months- $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,9)`; species abundance: 1 month- $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,7)`; 12 months- $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,9)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:invab)).
At 1 month into the experiment, species richness increased while species abundance decreased in control plots, though neither changes were significant( Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:invab)).
Then, at 12 months into the experiment, both species richness and abundance in control plots decreased, but only species abundance was significant ( $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,8)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:invab)).

##Clonal Invertebrates
There were no significant differences between treatments for species richness of clonal invertebrates ( Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)). Species abundance could not be analyzed because of difficulty defining individuals in a colony.


##Species Turnover
When comparing species turnover from 1 month to 12 months in sponge treatment plots, the overall turnover rates show an increase in species gained for fish and non-clonal invertebrates, which parallels the results from the univariate analysis (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots).
In structure and control plots there appears to be a decrease in species gained and increase in species lost for both fish and non-clonal invertebrates, also supporting the results from th univariate analyses (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots). \par

For clonal invertebrates, species turnover from 1 to 12 months did not show differences in treatment plots for species gained or lost (Fig. S2). 
The lack of differences in species turnover among treatments coincides with lack of change in species richness at 1 on 12 months into the experiment. 

## Compositional Vectors
```{r fish.env4 , include=FALSE}
source("scripts_comm/07_compositional_vectors.R")
```  
Fish species were significantly difference among treatments in vector length and angle ( $\beta$ = `r aov.res(fish.vl.aov.sum,1)`; $\beta$ = `r aov.res(fish.angle.aov.sum,1)` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:vector-plots)). 
Sponge treatment vectors appear to relatively be pointing in the same direction and have similar long vector lengths compared to other treatments in the fish community(Fig. \@ref(fig:vector-plots)).
The most prevalent fish species contributing to the differences among treatment plots were grunts, damselfish, slippery dicks, and green blotch parrotfish (Fig. \@ref(fig:vector-plots)).\par 
For clonal and non-clonal invertebrates, there were no significant differences among treatments in vector length nor angle.
However, the most prevalent non-clonal invertebrate species contributing the communities within the treatment plots were ceriths, welks, and sea squirts and the  clonal invertebrate species were pink tunicates, white tunicates, and black and orange tunicates (Fig. \@ref(fig:vector-plots)).

# Discussion  

Ecosystem engineers can affect many aspects of an ecosystem including habitat structure, resource availability and location, and community structure and dynamics [@Jones1994; @Anderson1992; @Byers2006].
Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first in situ experiment to test the effects of the presence of *I. felix* on species richness, abundance, and species turnover as an ecosystem engineer in a subtropical seagrass ecosystem over a 1.5 year experiment.
We found that species richness and abundance increased  after 1 month and 1 year in the presence of *I. felix* while decreasing or remaining the same without the sponge presence in seagrass ecosystems. \par

This study presents an ecosystem engineer that can affect community structure in terms of species richness, abundance, and turnover, but the mechanism of this interaction is unclear.
The change in community structure could be due to the indirect effects of *I. felix* releasing bioavailable forms of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment [@Southwell2008; Archer2017] which has been shown to increase primary production in seagrass beds [@Archer2021].
This increase in primary producers could bring in more organisms that use them for food and shelter. However, it is possible that *I. felix* acts as a food source in itself, attracting specific species that eat sponges [@Wulff1997].
It is important to note that, for this experiment, the *I. felix* sponge within the plots were encased in a cage, which would restrict large fish and invertebrates from consuming it.
More research is still needed to show the exact mechanism for how this ecosystem engineer changes the community structure in seagrass ecosystems. \par

	Two major fishes observed in treatments with *I. felix* present were grunts and damselfish.
The grunts and damselfish were highly abundant in sponge treatments and less in control and stucture control.
Other people have shown grunts to be sponge associated and they are associated because….
It is possible the grunts in our experiment were highly abundant in sponge treatments because … like ref causing a statistical shift in the fish community.
However, more researcher on sponge-grunt interactions is needed to fully understand this mechanism.\par

When selecting the statistical model that would explain the most variance, there were a few models that came in close second (i.e. were not >2 delta aicc away from top model) to our treatment model for invertebrate species richness and abundance.
Algal community, seagrass structure, and seagrass productivity, individually, were all close top models to treatment.
However, treatment always had the lowest AIC value and therefore the model we chose for analysis.
We further explored those models (which can be found in the supplement) to find that they showed similar results of species richness and abundance being higher in real treatments after 1 and 12 months into the experiment with no change or decrease in species richness and abundance in control and structure control plots.
This provides further support to our findings that the ecosystem engineer, I felix, has cascading effects on seagrass communities. \par

Many sponges have been shown to act as a habitat structure to invertebrates.
Specifically, _____ found invertebrates using a sponge as a habitat and structure to hide from predators.
However, we did not find these species present in our experiment.
More research should be performed on I. felix as a habitat structure. \par

	It is important to understand ecosystem engineers (e.g. *I. felix*) effects on the organisms around them because it can result in changes in the community structure and dynamics, therefore indirectly influencing ecosystem functions and services provided by the community.
We studied the effect of the presence of an ecosystem engineer, *I felix*, on species richness, abundance, and turnover in low impact seagrass beds and found that sponge presence can increase species richness and abundance and maintain turnover rates.
Thus, this study is another in situ example of how one organism, an ecosystem engineer, can affect an entire community.
Additional research is needed to find the mechanism through which *I. felix* influences seagrass bed community, and if the influence direction changes in impacted systems. \par
