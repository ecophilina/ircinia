# Abstract  

Ecosystem engineers can have profound effects on biodiversity and community structure.
Seagrass meadows act as ecosystem engineers and support a wide variety of organisms.
Sponges are another possible example, but we know little about their relationships with fish and invertebrate communities in seagrass systems.
This study explored the effects of the marine sponge, Ircinia felix, on fish and invertebrate taxa richness, abundance, turnover, and community composition in a subtropical seagrass bed through a 1.5-year field experiment performed in The Bahamas.
We recorded the fish, non-clonal invertebrate, and clonal invertebrate communities present in 5 × 5 m plots with the addition of either a live sponge, a polypropylene sponge replica (structure), or no additional structure (control).
Sponge presence alone explained the most variance in fish and non-clonal invertebrate communities, while no change in the clonal invertebrate community was detected.
Fish and non-clonal invertebrate taxa richness and abundance significantly increased over time in the presence of I. felix, but decreased or remained stable in the other plot types.
Sponge presence increased the number of new taxa gained, and reduced the number lost, for both fish and non-clonal invertebrates.
Finally, we found that sponge presence shifted the entire fish community over time and across taxa space. 
Our study exemplifies sponges acting as ecosystem engineers in seagrass systems, however, repetition of our research is needed to support confirm our results.\par

# Introduction 

Ecosystem engineers [*sensu* @Jones1994] are organisms that impact ecosystem structure and function by altering the physical and/or biological aspects of a system. 
They can create or modify entire habitats, ultimately influencing the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms [@Byers2006]. 
@Jones1994 coined the term ecosystem engineer almost 30 years ago, however, we still lack an understanding of which taxa fill this role in many systems [@Byers2006]. 
More so, we lack an understanding of the multitude of ecosystem engineers within one system and their potential to affect the community and ecosystem characteristics interactively.
\par 
Seagrasses are ecosystem engineers that form beds supporting a wide range of organisms [@Hori2009]. 
They provide shelter to numerous species at multiple life stages [@James1994; @Nakamura2012], are a food source [@Vicente1980], and play a key role in nutrient cycling [@Hemminga1991].
*Thalassia testudinum*, turtle grass, positively affects crustacean and fish abundance, species diversity, and species evenness when compared to sand habitat[@Arrivillaga1999; @Duffy2006 @Heck &
Orth 1980, Orth et al. 1984)].
In addition, fish diversity and abundance are influenced by the morphological components and structural complexity of seagrass beds [@Duffy2006; @Hori2009 @Bell2006).
Sponges are among the many organisms seagrass beds support.
Sponges possess many traits (e.g., create complex structure) that suggest they may also act as ecosystem engineers in seagrass systems.\par

Sponges can add to the structural complexity of a habitat, alter localized water flow, stabilize substrate, and act as a settlement substrate for sessile organisms [@Bell2008; @Wulff1984].
Some sponges have extensive microbial communities and macrofauna in and on their tissue [@Wulff2006; @Taylor2007; @Bell2008] and can provide camouflage and protection to other organisms [@McClay1983; @Martin1992]. 
Sponges  and their associated microbial communities can also act as a source of bioavailable forms of phosphorus and nitrogen in seagrass beds, especially important under oligotrophic conditions [@Archer2017; @Southwell2008; @Diaz1997].
Likely as a result of the this nutrient cycling, one sponge has been experimentally shown to facilitate primary production in sub-tropical seagrass beds [@Archer2021].
Combined, these traits suggest sponges have considerable potential to enhance the biodiversity of seagrass communities.\par

Despite their potential to significantly affect the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within a system, the effects of sponges on communities have been underappreciated [@Bell2008].
To the best of our knowledge, no research has investigated the effects of a marine sponge on biodiversity in seagrass beds.
Seagrass beds are influenced by anthropogenic factors that threaten their biodiversity and function world wide [@Tin2021; @Orth2006; @Waycott2009]. 
Therefore, it is important to understand what drives diversity in these systems so that we can facilitate management and restoration. 
To this end, we investigated the effect of sponge presence on biodiversity within a relatively undisturbed seagrass ecosystem.\par

We investigated the impact of the sponge, *Ircinia felix*, on seagrass bed-associated communities. 
Using a 1.5 yr field-based experiment, we examined how sponge presence influenced fish and invertebrate taxa richness, abundance, taxa turnover, and community compositional vectors.
Because seagrass bed characteristics have previously been shown to affect fish and invertebrate communities, and *I. felix* increases growth and abundance of seagrasses and macroalgae, we further explored direct and indirect affects of sponge presence on the community.
If an effect on the community variables was detected, we tested whether it was better explained by the presence of the sponge alone (i.e., a direct effect), the enhancement of the dominant primary producers (macroalgae and seagrasses; i.e, an indirect effect), or a combination of the two.
We predicted that seagrass beds with *I. felix* would have higher taxa richness and abundance than seagrass beds without *I felix*.
We hypothesized that, if an effect was detected, the presence of *I. felix* would affect the community more than the abundance of the dominant primary producers [@Archer2021].
<!-- FC not sure if I made this more clear or if I should just remove the sentence all together# -->
We hypothesized that community richness would be influenced by a combination of direct effects of the presence of *I. felix* and indirect effects through changes in the abundance of the dominant primary producers.
We hypothesized that changes in taxa richness observed when *I. felix* is present would be explained by both fewer lost taxa and more taxa gained over time compared to other treatments, resulting in lower taxa turnover.
As a result of these predicted changes, we expected that the presence of *I.felix* would result in a change in community structure over time.\par

# Methods  

## Study site and experimental design  

This study was conducted in a continuous subtidal seagrass bed (~1 m low tide depth) on the southern region of Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas (26.02610 N, 77.37408 W). 
Within the seagrass bed, we delineated fifteen 5 × 5 m plots by placing wooden stakes at the corners and center of each plot on June 9, 2013. 
All plots were separated >2 m. 
We sampled the fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities, as well as all explanatory variables (see below), once before the beginning of the experiment and again at 1 and 12 months after the treatments were established. 
Sponge (n=5), structure (n=5), and control (n=5) treatments were randomly assigned to plots. 
At the center of each sponge treatment plot, we placed one living sponge (*I. felix*, average volume ± standard deviation, 2.5 ± 0.75 L).
The structure treatment received a polypropylene model of a sponge, also placed at the center of each plot.
Both live and model sponges were contained within a cage to keep the sponge stationary.
The control plots remained unaltered.
Within the first month of the experiment, we replaced 3 live sponges when they showed signs of dying.
Live sponges were monitored throughout the rest of the experiment but no additional replacements were necessary.\par

## Faunal community

We monitored the response of the fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities during each summer sampling event.
On each sampling occasion, all fish were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic unit, counted, and recorded withi each plot during a five minute period.
Small silvery pelagic fishes which form large schools (e.g. fishes in the families Atherinopsidae and Clupeidae) were excluded from analyses following @Peters2015.
The macroinvertebrate community was quantified within a 3 m × 1 m band extending from the center of the plot [expdesign figure].
All macroinvertebrates were identified to lowest possible taxanomic level and recorded.
If identification was not possible *in situ*, a representative sample was photographed and subsequently collected.
Fish and macroinvertebrates were considered separately in all analyses. \par

## Primary producer covariates

@Archer2021 recently showed that *I. felix* facilitated primary producers in these same plots.
Seagrass growth, and seagrass and macroalgal abundance from @Archer2021 were used to calculate seagrass productivity, and seagrass and macroalgal structure for our analysis.
Seagrass productivity was calculated by multiplying the average growth per shoot by the total shoot density for *T. testudinum* for each plot at each sampling point.
Seagrass structure was calculated as the mean number of seagrass shoots (i.e., shoot density) for all seagrass species (*Halodule wrightii, Syringodium filiforme, and T. testudinum*) in twelve 20 × 20  cm “sub-quadrats” per plot at each sampling event.
Macroalgal structure was calculated as the total macroalgal abundance across all taxa at each sampling event.
Drift algae (e.g., *Karenia brevis*) were not included. 
Seagrass productivity, seagrass structure, and macroalgal structure were centered and standardized by two standard deviations to allow effect size comparisons between continuous and factor covariates within models [@Schielzeth2010]. \par

## Statistical Analyses

All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.0 [@RCoreTeam2021]. 

*Total abundance and taxa richness*

We analyzed total abundance and taxa richness on three faunal communities: fish, non-clonal invertebrates, and clonal invertebrates.
First, we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to confirm that none of the faunal communities differed in total abundance or taxa richness between the treatment plot types at the start of the experiment (sampling month = 0).
Next, we tested for differences in overall abundance and taxa richness of each faunal community using univariate Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), with sponge presence as the reference level when treatment was included in the model.
We chose multiple model configurations to represent the biological hypotheses that could best explain community changes within seagrass plots.
Specifically, sponge presence, seagrass productivity, seagrass structure, and macroalgal structure were each modeled separately and additively to represent sponge presence alone, three characteristics of primary producers, and the combined effects of changes in primary producers and the presence of the sponge (Table S1-3).
All models included a random effect for plot, sampling month as a factor, and, for models including treatment, an interaction between treatment and time.
All models were fitted with a Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution, parametrized via the mean and a log link and implemented using the `glmmTMB` package [@Brooks2017; @Huang2017].
We reviewed the residuals of all model configurations to confirm that GLMM assumptions were met.
Specifically, residuals were tested for compliance with model assumptions using the DHARMa package and a custom-built function to test for over-dispersion.
We used the package `AICcmodavg` [@Mazerolle2020] to create model selection tables based on Akaike Information Criterion scores (AICc).
All models within two $\delta$ AICc of the best-supported model are considered to be well-supported.\par

*Taxa Turnover*

Increases in taxa richness through time can result from either increases in colonization rates, or a reduction in the loss of taxa. 
To assess the relative rates at which taxa were gained or lost between sampling events, we used the `turnover` function in `codyn` package [@Hallett2020]. 
We assessed both components of taxa turnover separately for each faunal community in each plot type, and compared patterns of turnover among treatments at 1 and 12 months into the experiment.\par

*Compositional Vectors*

To assess community changes in a way that simultaneously accounts for changes in taxa richness, taxa identity, and (when available) abundance, we calculated compositional vectors for each faunal community in each plot [@McCune2002].
We used Hellinger's transformation to help minimize the effect of large differences in abundance between taxa [@Legendre2001].
We then conducted a principal components analysis (unconstrained by environmental predictors) using the `rda` function in the `vegan` package [@Oksanen2020].
The scores from this analysis were used to calculate a vector length and angle from 0 to 12 months into the experiment for each plot as per @McCune2002. 
We performed an ANOVA on each faunal community vector length and angle to test for significant differences among treatments.
When there were significant differences, we used a post-hoc analysis via a Tukey Honest Significant Difference test.
For visualization purposes, all vectors were standardized to the same initial position and then plotted to show how much a community changed over time (i.e., vector length) and in which direction across taxa space the community shifted (i.e., vector angle).\par

We present effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals.

## Total abundance and taxa richness 

*Fish*  

Throughout the experiment, a total of 15 fish taxa were observed.
At the start of the experiment between 0 and 2 individual fish, never of the same taxa, were found in each plot (mean = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 0, ]$f.abund),1)`, sd= `r round(sd(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 0, ]$f.abund),1)`). 
*Halichoeres bivittatus* (Slippery Dick) was the most common taxa. 
One month later, the maximum number of individuals per plot was 4, belonging to as many as 4 different taxa (mean abundance = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 1, ]$f.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 1, ]$spr),1)`) with *H. bivittatus* remaining the most abundant taxa across treatment types.
By the second summer of the experiment, the maximum number of individuals had increased to 7, belonging to as many as 6 different taxa (mean abundance = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 12, ]$f.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 12, ]$spr),1)`).
Juvenile grunts (*Haemulidae* spp.) were slightly more abundant than *H. bivittatus*.\par

The changes in both fish abundance and taxa richness were best explained by the sponge presence (Table 1, S1-3), such that in the presence of a sponge, fish abundance and taxa richness increased during the experiment (fish abundance effect size and confidence intervals: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,4)` and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,5)` at 1 and 12 months respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plots); taxa richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,4)` and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,5)` at 1 and 12 months respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)A).
By contrast, changes were non-significant for both control and structure plots (Figs. \@ref(fig:ab-plots) and \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)A).
Only control plots differed significantly from sponge plots after 12 months into the experiment (fish abundance effect size and confidence intervals: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,8)`; taxa richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,8)`).\par

*Invertebrates*

A total of 37 invertebrate taxa were observed in the experiment.
At the start of the experiment, between 0 and 4 individuals of non-clonal invertebrates from up to 3 taxa were found in each plot (mean abundance = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 0, ]$i.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 0, ]$spr),1)`).
Variable dog whelks *Phrontis alba* were the most abundant taxa. 
One month later, the maximum number of individuals per plot was up to `r range(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 1, ]$i.abund)[2]` individuals belonging to up to `r range(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 1, ]$spr)[2]` different taxa (mean abundance = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 1, ]$i.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 1, ]$spr),1)`) with more turtle grass anemones (*Viatrix globulifera*) and ceriths (*Cerithium spp.*) recorded than *P. alba*.
By the second summer of the experiment, the maximum number of individuals was `r range(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 12, ]$i.abund)[2]`, belonging to as many as `r range(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 12, ]$spr)[2]` different taxa (mean abundance = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 12, ]$i.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 12, ]$spr),1)`) and *P. alba* were once again the most abundant taxa per plot, followed by Blue crabs (*Callinectes sapidus*). \par

Changes in non-clonal invertebrate abundance and taxa richness were also best explained by sponge presence (Table 1), but other models were equally well-supported for both abundance and taxa richness  (Table 1; S1).
Abundance of non-clonal invertebrates significantly increased after 1 and 12 months in the presence of a sponge ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,4)` and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,5)` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plots)).
Only after 12 months were abundances significantly lower in both control and structure plots than in sponge plots ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,8)` and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,9)` respectively).
Seagrass productivity appeared to explain some of this change ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.prod.sum,6)`), but there was still a significant difference between structure plots and sponge plots after accounting for the differences in seagrass productivity ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.prod.sum,10)`).
Likewise, the model including seagrass structure was well-supported (Table 1); however, it's contribution did not reach significance ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.struct.sum,6)`) suggesting that new growth rather than shoot density alone had some impact on the non-clonal invertebrate abundance. 
Taxa richness also increased over time in the presence of a sponge ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,4)` at 1 month and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,5)` at 12 months, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)).
After 12 months, taxa richness was lower in both control and structure plots than in the sponge plots, although only significantly so for the latter (control: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,8)`; structure: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,9)`).
However, the other well-supported model did not include a treatment effect, suggesting that the effect of the sponge might be accounted for through differences in macroalgal structure facilitated by the presence of a sponge ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.alg.sum,4)`; Fig. \@ref(fig:inverts-by-algae)).

## Taxa Turnover  

For both fish and invertebrates, between the start of the experiment and the first sampling event, most plots across treatment types gained more taxa than they lost (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots) B left panel), yet this resulted in no difference between treatments for both fish (gained: F~`r aov.df(fishgain1[[1]], 1)`~ `r aov.res(fishgain1[[1]], 1)`; fish lost: F~`r aov.df(fishloss1[[1]], 1)`~ `r aov.res(fishloss1[[1]], 1)`) and invertebrates (gained: F~`r aov.df(invgain1[[1]], 1)`~ `r aov.res(invgain1[[1]], 1)`; lost: F~`r aov.df(invloss1[[1]], 1)`~ `r aov.res(invloss1[[1]], 1)`).
After 12 months, however, sponge treatment plots tended to gain the most new fish (F~`r aov.df(fishgain12[[1]], 1)`~ `r aov.res(fishgain12[[1]], 1)` with sponge-control = `r tukey.res(fishgain12.tuk[[1]], 2)` and sponge-structure = `r tukey.res(fishgain12.tuk[[1]], 3)` while structure-control = `r tukey.res(fishgain12.tuk[[1]], 1)`) and invertebrate (F~`r aov.df(invgain12[[1]], 1)`~ `r aov.res(invgain12[[1]], 1)` with sponge-control = `r tukey.res(invgain12.tuk[[1]], 2)` and sponge-structure = `r tukey.res(invgain12.tuk[[1]], 3)` while structure-control = `r tukey.res(invgain12.tuk[[1]], 1)`) taxa, while also still retaining more fish taxa (F~`r aov.df(fishloss12[[1]], 1)`~ `r aov.res(fishloss12[[1]], 1)` with sponge-control = `r tukey.res(fishloss12.tuk[[1]], 2)` and sponge-structure = `r tukey.res(fishloss12.tuk[[1]], 3)` while structure-control = `r tukey.res(fishloss12.tuk[[1]], 1)`); Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots) B right panel).
This pattern is similar for both fish and invertebrates, although overall the proportion of invertebrates lost did not differ between treatments (F~`r aov.df(invloss12[[1]], 1)`~ `r aov.res(invloss12[[1]], 1)`). \par


## Compositional Vectors

By 12 months into the experiment, the fish communities differed significantly by treatment for both vector length and angle, meaning they differed in the how much they changed over time and in direction of change across taxa space (vector length:  F~`r aov.df2(fish.vl.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(fish.vl.aov.sum,1)`; vector angle: F~`r aov.df2(fish.angle.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(fish.angle.aov.sum,1)`). 
The post-hoc analysis of vector lengths showed a significant difference in how much the fish communities changed over time between the control and sponge presence treatment plots and between the structure and sponge presence treatment plots, with control and structure treatment plots both having less change in community over time when compared to the sponge presence treatment plots (control-sponge: `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,1)`; structure-sponge `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,2)`). 
However, there was no difference in the amount of change in the fish community between structure and control treatment plots (`r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,3)`). 
The post-hoc analysis of the vector angles showed no significant difference in the direction in which the fish communities shifted across taxa space between the control and sponge presence treatment plots, which may be due to the small change in the control plot communities over time (control-sponge: `r tukey.res(fish.angle.aov.tuk,1)`; Fig. \@ref(fig:vector-plots)`). 
By contrast, there were differences in the direction of the communities across taxa space between the structure and sponge presence treatment plots, as well as between the structure and control treatment plots, with structure treatment plots having less change in communities across taxa space than both sponge presence or control (structure-sponge: `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,2)`; structure-control `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,3)`). \par

By 12 months into the experiment, the invertebrate communities had no differences across treatment plot types for vector length and angle, meaning they did not differ in the amount of change over time nor in direction of change across taxa space (vector length:  F~`r aov.df2(inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`; vector angle: F~`r aov.df2(inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`).\par

# Discussion  

Ecosystem engineers can affect habitat structure, resource availability, and location, as well as community structure and dynamics [@Jones1994; @Anderson1992; @Byers2006].
Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first *in situ* experiment examining if sponges act as ecosystem engineers in seagrass beds.
We did this by testing the affect of *I. felix* presence in subtropical seagrass beds on taxa richness, abundance, taxa turnover, and community compositional vectors over a 1.5 yr experiment.
We found that sponge presence alone explained the most variance in fish and invertebrate communities.
In fish and invertebrates, taxa richness and abundance increased over time with the presence of *I. felix* while decreasing or remaining unchanged without the sponge presence. 
Overtime, sponge presence was associated with more taxa for fish and invertebrates.
Finally, we found that sponge presence shifted the entire fish community over time across taxa space. \par

Our results showed that fish richness and abundance were positively correlated with sponge presence.
The added structural complexity from the sponge may contribute to the increase in fish richness and abundance. 
@Ferrari2018 showed that fish abundance could be best explained by benthic biota and complexity metrics in subtropical reefs. 
@Gratwicke2005 also found similar results with fish species richness being positively correlated with rugosity and a variety of growth forms in subtropical habitats, including seagrass beds.
However, our results suggest *I. felix* effects on fish species richness and abundance exceed what would be expected from structure alone.
In addition, there was an increase of invertebrate species richness and abundance in the sponge presence plots, which could provide more prey species available for fish to feed on. 
@Brook1977 suggested that fish population in *T. testudinum* dominant seagrass beds were limited by abundance of polychaetes and crustaceans. 
@Yeager2012 results parrellel the hypothesis that higher food availability associated with increase seagrass cover positively correlates with abundance of white grunts (*Haemulon plumierii*).
The added structural complexity of the seagrass bed from the sponge, along with the increase of food availability with sponge presence, could be a reasonable hypothesis for the increase in fish richness and abundance.
 However, further research is needed to tease apart the relative importance of structural complexity and food availability via sponge presence. \par
 
In addition to the increase in fish richness and abundance, we also saw a shift in the fish community structure. 
With sponge presence, the fish community includede species typically associated with reefs, such as grunts (*Haemulidae* spp.), damselfish (*Pomacentridae* spp.), and Nassau grouper (*Epinephelus striatus*).
Other research has shown grunts to be associated with coral reefs and seagrass beds across the Caribbean [@Nagelkerken2008; @CocheretdelaMoriniere2003].
Juvenile grunts (*Haemulidae* spp.) have been well-documented for using seagrass as nursery habitat [@Arrivillaga1999; @Yeager2012; @CocheretdelaMoriniere2003], however, little has been studied on their relation to sponges. 
Both juvenile grunts (*Haemulidae* spp.) and beaugregory damselfish (*Stegastes leucostictus*) partially rely on invertebrates as a food source [@Cervigon1966]. 
Nassau groupers (*Epinephelus striatus*) associate with structure and use seagrass beds as feeding grounds.
@Eggleston1998 found that the juvenile and midsize Nassau grouper (*Epinephelus striatus*) depend on crustaceans as a food source.
Likely, the increased species richness and abundance of non-clonal invertebrates with sponge presence contributed to the colonization of structure-associated fish species that could take advantage of increased invertebrate abundance.\par

Although the sponge presence model explained the most variance for non-clonal invertebrate taxa richness and abundance, there were some models that fell within less than 2 $\delta AICc values that cannot be ruled out: macroalgal structure, sponge presence + seagrass productivity, sponge presence + seagrass structure(Table 1). 
This suggests that sponge presence by enhancement of primary producers(i.e. seagrass and macroalgal structure) may impact the invertebrate communities, however, not as much as sponge presence alone. 
In @Archer2021, macroalgal structure significantly increased over time in the presence of *I. felix*. 
Other studies support the idea that marcoinvertebrates richness and abundance increase with increasing seagrass shoot density[@Webster1998;x;x]. 
Marine sponges can have a wide range  of microbes and macrofauna living within their canals[@Wulff2006; @Taylor2007; @Bell2008] which could explain the increase in invertebrate species richness and abundance.
Notably, we did not measure sediment infauna invertebrate communities nor invertebrates residing within the sponge, so the influence of the sponge on non-clonal invertebrate communities could be much larger than what we present.
Further research is needed to capture the affects of sponge presence in seagrass beds for invertebrates that include sediment infauna and resident sponge habitat invertebrates. \par

Overall, we found that sponge presence was correlated with taxa retention and taxa gain. 
For fish and non-clonal invertebrates alike, we saw a maintenance and/or a shift towards taxa gained after 12 months (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)), while control and structure treatment plots showed loss in taxa (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)). 
This alludes that sponges may alleviate conditions that lead to taxa loss in sub-tropical seagrass beds. 
Sponge grounds have been described as key marine habitats and enhance diversity of the community around them [@Maldonado2017; @Beazley2013].  
Evenmoreso, their role in structural complexity, habitat contribution, enhancement to primary producers, and other functional roles support their potential ability to alleviate taxa loss in sub-tropical seagrass beds positive influences on taxa around them [@Ferrari2018;@Gratwicke2005;@Wulff2006; @Taylor2007; @Bell2008; @Archer2021].
We suggest more *in situ* experiments of sponges on seagrass beds with the addition of stressors that could contribute to taxa loss. \par

# Conclusion
It is important to understand ecosystem engineers affects on the organisms around them because it can result in changes in the community structure and dynamics, therefore indirectly influencing ecosystem functions and services provided by the community.
We studied the effect of the presence of an ecosystem engineer, *I felix*, on taxa richness, abundance, turnover, and community composition in low impact seagrass beds and found that sponge presence can increase taxa richness and abundance, maintain turnover rates, and shift fish communities.
Thus, this study is another *in situ* example of how an ecosystem engineer can affect an entire community while other ecosystem engineers exist within that system.
Additional research is needed to explore which aspects of *I. felix* influences seagrass bed communities, and if the affect changes in impacted systems. \par
