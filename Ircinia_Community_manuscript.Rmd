# Introduction  

All habitats on earth are influenced by ecosystem engineers. 
Ecosystem engineers [*sensu* @Jones1994] are organisms that directly or indirectly change the flow of resources (excluding their own living or dead tissue) to other species, through changes in an ecosystem’s biotic or abiotic materials. **While correct this sentence gets down into the weeds real quickly, I'd maybe suggest something along the lines of - Ecosystem engineers [*sensu* @Jones1994] are organisms that have a larger impact on ecosystem structure and function than their abundance would suggest.**
Because of this interaction, ecosystem engineers can create, change, or destroy entire habitats. **Suggest changing "because of this interaction" - you haven't really described an interaction just yet - something like Consequently might work**
Ecosystem engineers can have significant effects on the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within their community [@Jones1994]. **I think you can combine this with the sentence above so it reads... habitats and have significant effects...**
Thus, it is important that we study ecosystem engineer’s cascading effects on associated communities, especially because of the current major environmental problems, like the overexploitation of marine ecosystem engineers [@Coleman2002]. **I think we need to add in identifying ecosystem engineers here - right now sponges are not considered ecosystem engineers in seagrass ecosystems. Also I would change this to read "especially due to the overexploitation of many marine ecosystem engineers**\par

There are two types of ecosystem engineers: autogenic and allogenic. **Right now this doesn't really flow from the last paragraph - I think if you change the last sentence of the previous paragraph to focus on how we don't actually know which species are acting as ecosystem engineers in many systems this will make more sense. Right now with the last sentence focusing on needing to study ecosystem engineer's cascading effects and overexploitation you expect this paragraph to be about one of those two things.**
Autogenic engineers alter the environment by their physical structures [@Jones1994]. **change by to through**
For example, crustose coralline algae on coral reefs attenuate wave energy with their hard, calcareous structure which protects the corals from damage by wave energy [@Anderson1992]. 
This function provides stabilization to the coral reefs, which are foundation species [*sensu* @Dayton1972 as refined by @Bruno2001], a species that provides habitat and alters abiotic conditions with net positive effects on diversity, distribution, and abundance of other organisms [@Altieri 2014]. **This sentence is a lot. I don't think we need to define foundation species specifically here since it isn't the focus of the paper. I suggest changing it and the previous sentence a bit - in the previous sentence I'd make it: ...protects the foundation species [*sensu* @Dayton1972 as refined by @Bruno2001], corals, from damage by wave energy, stabilizing the reef and promoting the biodiversity it supports [@Anderson1992].**
Additionally, an allogenic engineer alters the environment by changing living or non-living materials from one physical state to another [@Jones1994]. **I don't think additionally is the right transition here**
Again, crustose coralline algae secretes a chemical that binds suspended sediment together forming calcareous mounds on the benthos [@Anderson1992; @Goreau1963]. **I'd delete "Again"**
The calcareous mounds act as a hard substrate in which numerous organisms need to settle and survive [@Goreau1963]. 
Evidently, an organism can be both an autogenic and allogenic ecosystem engineer. 
In addition, the crustose coralline algae exemplifies the potential effects that ecosystem engineers have on foundation species and associated communities. **I think I'd rework this paragraph a little bit. You can start out with the same first sentence, then I'd give the allogenic engineer definition then the autogenic. Then state that an ecosystem engineer can be one or both. For example - give the crustose coraline algae but change the order so its allogenic then autogenic. Then talk about how ecosystem engineers can have even larger impacts on the biodiversity associated with a system when they influence the foundation species** \par

Seagrass beds are foundation species and **form** important coastal ecosystems worldwide; they provide habitat [@James1994], stabilize sediments [@Folmer2012], attenuate wave energy [@Fonseca1992], and are important locations for nutrient cycling [@Hemminga1991]. **A couple things - first this text is't quite different enough from our other paper, second - I think you should focus more on the biodiversity seagrass beds support and why. Then you can talk about how sponges are a common component of seagrass beds and that they have the potential to act as ecosystem engineers in seagrass beds because they do things like provide structure and act as sources of nutrients in oligotrophic systems. But we don't know if sponges can be considered ecosystem engineers in seagrass beds yet**
Many studies have shown how seagrass beds affect their dependent communities [@Healey2004; @Hori2009]. 
However, the effects that some ecosystem engineers, specifically marine sponges, have on seagrass communities are underrepresented and underappreciated in marine systems [@Bell2008]. \par 

**So, after reading the paragraph below I think you are approaching this in a different way than I thought. It seems like you're approaching it from a place of "we know sponges can be ecosystem engineers now how do they impact communities? I'm fine with that approach, but if that's the way you want to go I think the intro should be reorganized. The first paragraph is generally fine. But after that I'd switch to making the case for sponges as ecosystem engineers in seargass beds  - introduce seagrass beds in the second paragraph then shift to making the case for sponges as ecosystem engineers in seagrass beds. Then talk about why you'd expect ecosystem engineers to have cascading consequences on seagrass bed biodiversity, then use the last parargaph of the intro largely as is.** 
Marine sponges can be considered ecosystem engineers because they retain and recycle energy and nutrients, act as microhabitats, and facilitate primary production [@Archer2021; @Bell2008]. 
A prime example is *Ircinia felix*, a high microbial abundant sponge common to reefs and seagrass beds throughout the sub-tropical Atlantic and Caribbean [@Diaz2005; @Loh2014]. 
This sponge, like many found in The Bahamas, hosts a dense and diverse microbiome [@Weisz2008] which facilitates complex nutrient transformations, having indirect effects on ambient nutrient and energy availability [@Archer2017]. 
Like the crustose coralline algae, *Irciania felix* can act as both an autogenic and allogenic ecosystem engineer. 
Because sponges are being threatened by anthropogenic stressors that may change the composition and stability of sponge’s microbiome, it is important that we study how the ecosystem engineers, sponges, affect organisms within their community in a low-impact environment [@Pita2018].  
Furthermore, Archer et al. (2021) describes the effects of *Ircinia felix* on seagrass beds (foundation species)in a low-impact environment.  
Our goal is to further Archer et al.’s [2021] findings on the ecosystem engineer [*Ircinia felix*] to the fish and macroinvertebrate community level. \par

While sponges of all sizes are common in seagrass beds, larger sponges are likely to have a stronger influence on their environment due to both their size and the volume of water they filter. **need to make this different than the wording in the previous paper**
In the present study, we investigated the impact of a moderately large sponge, [*Ircinia felix*], on seagrass bed associated communities. 
Using a 1.5 yr field-based experiment, we examined how sponge presence influenced fish and invertebrate species richness, abundance, and turnover. 
Because *Ircinia felix* was found to enhance primary producers in seagrass beds [@Archer2021] we hypothesize that the ecosystem engineer will enhance the community as well. 
Specifically, we hypothesize that seagrass beds with *Ircinia felix* will have higher species richness and abundance after one year than seagrass beds without *Ircinia felix* present. 
We also hypothesize that species turnover in treatments with *Ircinia felix* will be maintained over time while treatments without will have more disappearance and less appearance of new species over time. \par

# Methods  

## Study site and experimental design  
 
This study was conducted in a continuous subtidal seagrass bed (1.1 m low tide depth) on Southern Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas (26.02610 N, 77.37408 W). 
Depth, temperature, and salinity were consistent across the seagrass bed.
Within the seagrass bed, fifteen 5 x 5 m plots were delineated on June 9, 2013 by placing wooden stakes at the corners and center of each plot. 
All plots were separated >2 m. 
The fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities as well as all explanatory variables (see below) were sampled once before the beginning of the experiment and again at 1 and 12 months after the treatments were established. 
Control (n=5), structure (n=5), and sponge (n=5) treatments were randomly assigned to plots. 
**THE TEXT BELOW WAS COPIED DIRECTLY FROM THE FIRST MANUSCRIPT MUST BE REWORDED** 
Control plots were not manipulated.
A polypropylene model of a sponge was placed inside a cage at the center of each structure plot.
A single living sponge (*I. felix*, average volume ± standard deviation, 2.5 ± 0.75 L) was placed inside a cage in the center of each sponge plot.
Live sponges were replaced as needed with a total of 3 individual sponge replacements, all occurring within the first month of the experiment.\par 

## Community Structure Response Variables  
The response of the fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities were monitored throughout the course of the experiment. 
The fish community was quantified by observing the plot for 5 minutes, all fish observed within the plot during the observation period were recorded. 
For analysis small silvery pelagic fishes which form large schools (e.g. fishes in the families Atherinopsidae and Clupeidae) were excluded following @peters2015. 
The macroinvertebrate community were quantified within a 3 m x 1 m band extending from the center of the plot. 
All macroinvertebrates were identified to genus and recorded. 
If identification was not possible in situ a representative sample was photographed and subsequently collected.\par 

***compois = Conway–Maxwell–Poisson parametrized via the mean and a log link (Huang 2017)***

## Statistical Analyses
Three sampling events occured in the Summer: one in June (0 months into the experiment) and two in July (1 and 12 months into the experiment). The sampling events were grouped by years into the experiment for temporal examination.

Univariate analyses
Univariate analyses were performed on three community groupings: fish, non-clonal invertebrates, and clonal invertebrates. All groupings were fit with a Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution parametrized via the mean and a log link (Huang 2017). Forward model selection was performed to determine the model explaining the most variance using corrected Akaike Infromation Criterion scores (AICc). The model with the lowest AICc value for species richness of each community grouping was reviewed in the final analyses.

Taxa Turnover
To visualize changes in taxa richness over time (i.e. taxa gained or lost relative to the total number of taxa observed across the two sampling events in July), we used the turnover function in "codyn" package.

In the sponge treatment, fish and invertebrate species richness increased at 1 and 12 months into the experiment (fish: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(tsdb.sum,4)`; structure: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(tsdf.sum,4)`; sponge: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(tsdr.sum,4)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:shootd)).

# Discussion  

Ecosystem engineers can affect many aspects of an ecosystem including habitat structure, resource availability and location, and community structure and dynamics [@Jones1994; @Anderson1992; @Byers2006].
Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first in situ experiment to test the effects of the presence of *I. felix* on species richness, abundance, and species turnover as an ecosystem engineer in a subtropical seagrass ecosystem over a 1.5 year experiment.
We found that species richness and abundance increased  after 1 month and 1 year in the presence of *I. felix* while decreasing or remaining the same without the sponge presence in seagrass ecosystems. \par

This study presents an ecosystem engineer that can affect community structure in terms of species richness, abundance, and turnover, but the mechanism of this interaction is unclear.
The change in community structure could be due to the indirect effects of *I. felix* releasing bioavailable forms of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment [@Southwell2008; Archer2017] which has been shown to increase primary production in seagrass beds [@Archer2021].
This increase in primary producers could bring in more organisms that use them for food and shelter. However, it is possible that *I. felix* acts as a food source in itself, attracting specific species that eat sponges [@Wulff1997].
It is important to note that, for this experiment, the *I. felix* sponge within the plots were encased in a cage, which would restrict large fish and invertebrates from consuming it.
More research is still needed to show the exact mechanism for how this ecosystem engineer changes the community structure in seagrass ecosystems. \par

	Two major fishes observed in treatments with *I. felix* present were grunts and damselfish.
The grunts and damselfish were highly abundant in sponge treatments and less in control and stucture control.
Other people have shown grunts to be sponge associated and they are associated because….
It is possible the grunts in our experiment were highly abundant in sponge treatments because … like ref causing a statistical shift in the fish community.
However, more researcher on sponge-grunt interactions is needed to fully understand this mechanism.\par

When selecting the statistical model that would explain the most variance, there were a few models that came in close second (i.e. were not >2 delta aicc away from top model) to our treatment model for invertebrate species richness and abundance.
Algal community, seagrass structure, and seagrass productivity, individually, were all close top models to treatment.
However, treatment always had the lowest AIC value and therefore the model we chose for analysis.
We further explored those models (which can be found in the supplement) to find that they showed similar results of species richness and abundance being higher in real treatments after 1 and 12 months into the experiment with no change or decrease in species richness and abundance in control and structure control plots.
This provides further support to our findings that the ecosystem engineer, I felix, has cascading effects on seagrass communities. \par

Many sponges have been shown to act as a habitat structure to invertebrates.
Specifically, _____ found invertebrates using a sponge as a habitat and structure to hide from predators.
However, we did not find these species present in our experiment.
More research should be performed on I. felix as a habitat structure. \par

	It is important to understand ecosystem engineers (e.g. *I. felix*) effects on the organisms around them because it can result in changes in the community structure and dynamics, therefore indirectly influencing ecosystem functions and services provided by the community.
We studied the effect of the presence of an ecosystem engineer, *I felix*, on species richness, abundance, and turnover in low impact seagrass beds and found that sponge presence can increase species richness and abundance and maintain turnover rates.
Thus, this study is another in situ example of how one organism, an ecosystem engineer, can affect an entire community.
Additional research is needed to find the mechanism through which *I. felix* influences seagrass bed community, and if the influence direction changes in impacted systems. \par
