# Abstract  

Ecosystem engineers are organisms that can have significant effects on biodiversity and community structure. 
<!-- rather than significant, what about profound or dramatic? --> 
<!-- I vote for profound. We can probably get by without saying "are organisms than can have" and just say "Ecosystem engineers can have profound...--> 
Thus, it is important to identify which organisms act as ecosystem engineers, how they interact with other ecosystem engineers, and how they affect the community surrounding them.
Along marine coastlines at all latitudes, seagrass meadows support a wide variety of organisms. 
<!-- Instead of "Along marine coastlines at all latitudes" we could just say "Globally" --> 
Within these habitats, marine sponges also have the potential to act as ecosystem engineers, yet we know little about how they affect the seagrass community.
<!-- because there are multiple species of seagrass saying "the seagrass community" makes it sound like we are focusing on seagrass. You've already said "within these habitats" so that makes it clear you're talking about in seagrass beds, so I would vote for changing this to "how they affect fish and invertebrate communities" --> 
This study explores the affects of the marine sponge, *I. felix*, on **fish and invertebrate** species richness, abundance, ~~species~~ turnover, and community composition in a sub-tropical seagrass bed through a 1.5 year field experiment performed in The Bahamas.
We recorded the fish, non-clonal invertebrate, and clonal invertebrate communities present in 5 x 5 m plots with the addition of either a live sponge, a polypropylene sponge replica (structure), or no additional structures (control). 
Sponge presence alone explained the most variance in fish and non-clonal invertebrate communities, while no change in the clonal invertebrate community was detected.
Fish and non-clonal invertebrate species richness and abundance significantly increased over time in the presence of *I. felix*, but decreased or remained stable in other plot types.
Sponge presence slowed species turnover rates for fish and non-clonal invertebrates, while showing little to no change in species turnover for clonal invertebrates.
<!-- OR: Sponge presence increased the number of new species gained and reduced the number lost for both fish and non-clonal invertebrates, but showed no impact on species turnover for clonal invertebrates. --> <!-- yep this version -->
Finally, we found that sponge presence shifted the entire fish community over time and across species space.
This experiment was conducted in a low anthropogenic impact environment; thus, further research is needed to understand how the sponge affects seagrass communities in high impact environments.\par

# Introduction 

Ecosystem engineers [*sensu* @Jones1994] are organisms that impact an ecosystem's structure and function more so than their abundance would suggest.
They can create, or modify entire habitats, ultimately influencing the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within their community (REF?).
<!-- , which is important to preserve in a changing world [@Jones1994]. -->
Although, Jones (1994) coined the term "ecosystem engineer" almost 30 years ago, we still lack a thorough understanding of which species fulfill this role in many systems [@Byers2006].
<!-- Even more so, we lack an understanding of the multitude of ecosystem engineers residing in one habitat, and their potential to affect the ecosystem biodiversity on their own and together. --> <!-- ooooh I like this -->
Furthermore, we rarely appreciate the extent to which multiple ecosystem engineers residing in one habitat may interact to affect that ecosystem's biodiversity.
\par 

Seagrasses are well-known, important ecosystem engineers that form beds supporting a wide range of organisms [@Hori2009]. 
They provide shelter [@James1994] to numerous species and at multiple life stages [@Nakamura2012], act as a food source [@Vicente1980], and play a key role in nutrient cycling [@Hemminga1991].
<!-- This is where some text should be added talking about how biodiversity is related to seagrass density/abundance/structure and the productivity of the habitat. This will help set up our alternative hypotheses below -->
Marine sponges are among the many organisms seagrass beds support, but also have the potential to act as ecosystem engineers within these systems. \par

Marine sponges can add to the structural complexity of a habitat by altering local-scale water flow [@Bell2008], stabilizing the substrate [@Wulff1984], and acting as a settlement substrate for a range of sessile organisms [@Bell2008].
Some marine sponges also have numerous microbes and macrofauna living within them [@Wulff2006; @Taylor2007; @Bell2008] and can provide camouflage and protection to other organisms [@McClay1983; @Martin1992]. 
Sponges' microbial communities can also act as a source of bioavailable forms of phosphorus and nitrogen in seagrass beds under oligotrophic conditions [@Archer2017].
Likely as a result of the this nutrient cycling, at least one species of sponge has been experimentally shown to facilitate primary production in ~~low-impact,~~ sub-tropical seagrass beds [@Archer2021].
Combined, these mechanisms suggest sponges have considerable potential to enhance the biodiversity of seagrass communities. \par

<!-- The multiple interactions marine sponges have with other fauna and their ability to transform nutrients alludes to their potential to significantly affect the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within their community. -->
<!-- However, the effects of marine sponges on seagrass communities have long been underrepresented and underappreciated in marine systems [@Bell2008].  -->
<!-- Replace above 2 sentences with? -->
Despite ~~this obvious~~ **their** potential to significantly affect the distribution, diversity, and abundance of other organisms within their community, the effects of marine sponges on communities have long been underappreciated [@Bell2008].
To the best of our knowledge, no research has investigated the affects of a marine sponge on ~~the~~ biodiversity in seagrass beds. 
Because marine sponges are ~~being~~ threatened by anthropogenic stressors that may change the composition and stability of the sponge's microbiome, it is important that we study this ecosystem engineers' effect on the community in a low-impact environment [@Pita2018]. <!-- This logic is a bit off for me. It seems like we are setting up to argue that changes to a sponges' microbiome will have an impact on fish and invertebrate communities. I think a better setup would be to talk about how anthropogenic impacts threaten biodiversity world wide, particularly in seagrass beds, therefore its important to understand what drives diversity in these systems so that we can facilitate management and restoration.-->
Therefore, we investigated the effect of sponge presence on biodiversity within a relatively undisturbed seagrass ecosystem.
<!-- Furthermore, we also tested whether any observed effect of sponge presence could be better explained by the enhancement to the primary producers (i.e. other ecosystem engineers within the system as shown by Archer et al. [2021]), the presence of the sponge alone, or a combination of both.  -->
<!-- This is currently repeated in the para below. I think it is more necessary there? -->
\par

<!-- I changed the para below to the past tense. Not sure if that's what we want? But Sean changes all my writing to past tense so I'm assuming that's still the current convention even for active voice? --> <!-- I always struggle with this. Some things clearly happened in the past so should be past tense, but it doesn't always make sense. I think as long as we're consistent its fine. -->
Specifically, we investigated the impact of a moderately large sponge, [*Ircinia felix*], on seagrass bed associated communities. 
Using a 1.5 yr field-based experiment, we examined how sponge presence influenced fish and invertebrate species richness, abundance, turnover, and community compositional vectors.
<!-- If an affect was detected, we further explored if the affect was most likely due to enhancement of primary producers, sponge presence, or a combination of both. -->
If an affect was detected, we tested whether it was better explained by the enhancement to the dominant primary producers (macroalgae and seagrasses as shown by Archer et al. [2021]), the presence of the sponge alone, or a combination of both.
<!-- This needs to be set up a little bit better. I'll add some prompting above, but basically, we need to remind/inform our readers what is already known about how seagrass and macroalgal structure drives biodiversity in this system. -->
We predicted that seagrass beds with *I. felix* would have higher species richness and abundance over time than seagrass beds without *I felix* present.
Because a moderately large sponge can provide substantial structural complexity and nutrients to species other than macroalgae and seagrasses <!-- What are you thinking of here? if an important pathway it should be introduced before here -->, we hypothesized that the presence of *I. felix* would affect the community more than can be simply explained by changes in the abundance of the dominant primary producers.
We also hypothesized that species pools in treatments with *I. felix* would have fewer losses and more gains in the number of species over time when compared to treatments without the sponge present, resulting in less species turnover.
As a result of the above predictions, we also expected that the presence of *I.felix* would ultimately result in a change to the community composition over time.\par

# Methods  

## Study site and experimental design  

<!-- The methods are mostly in passive voice, so probably needs changing? I took a stab at the first para... -->
This study was conducted in a continuous subtidal seagrass bed (1.1 m low tide depth) on Southern Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas (26.02610 N, 77.37408 W). 
Depth, temperature, and salinity were consistent across the seagrass bed.
Within the seagrass bed, we delineated fifteen 5 x 5 m plots by placing wooden stakes at the corners and center of each plot on June 9, 2013. 
All plots were separated >2 m. 
We sampled the fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities, as well as all explanatory variables (see below), once before the beginning of the experiment and again at 1 and 12 months after the treatments were established. 
Sponge (n=5), structure (n=5), and control (n=5) treatments were randomly assigned to plots. 
At the center of each sponge treatment plot, we placed one living sponge (*I. felix*, average volume ± standard deviation, 2.5 ± 0.75 L).
The structure treatment received a polypropylene model of a sponge, also placed at the center of each plot.
Both live and model sponges were contained within a cage to keep the sponge stationary.
The control plots remained unaltered.
Within the first month of the experiment 3 live sponges were replaced when they showed signs of dying.
Live sponges were monitored throughout the rest of the experiment, but no additional replacements were necessary.\par

## Faunal community

<!-- Still in passive voice... -->
<!-- Do we need to add any additional comments about the taxonomic levels to which any species groups were identified? --> <!-- should probably specify lowest possible taxanomic level and change species to taxa throughout -->
<!-- Did I ever finish going through and changing taxa names to actual names and not my IDs?  remind me about this if I keep forgetting...-->
The response of the fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrate communities were monitored throughout the course of the experiment.
Sampling events occurred in the summer: one in June (0 months into the experiment) and two in July (1 and 12 months into the experiment).
These latter experimental sampling times were designated as year 1 and year 2 of the experiment, respectively.
On each occasion, all fish observed within each plot during a 5 min observation period were counted and recorded.
However, small silvery pelagic fishes which form large schools (e.g. fishes in the families Atherinopsidae and Clupeidae) were excluded from analyses following Peters et al. [2015]. <!-- double check to make sure this citation shows up in the references-->
The macroinvertebrate community were quantified within a 3 m x 1 m band extending from the center of the plot.
All macroinvertebrates were identified to ~~genus~~ the lowest possible taxanomic level and recorded.
If identification was not possible *in situ*, a representative sample was photographed and subsequently collected.
For clonal tunicates an accurate count of individuals was not feasible; therefore clonal species of tunicate were assessed simply as present/absent and analyzed separately from non-clonal invertebrates.\par
<!-- Maybe add a sentence here that states that "Fish, non-clonal invertebrates, and clonal invertebrates were therefore considered separately in all analyses." So we don't need to repeat this fact in all the following paras? --> <!-- like it -->

## Primary producers covariates

<!-- In order to explore (if an affect by treatment was detected) what best explained the affect (i.e enhancement of primary producers, sponge alone, or combination of both) additional predictor variables needed to be accounted for. --> <!-- I find this suggested sentence a bit awkward. To me the sentence below sets up the paragraph better-->
Archer et al. [2021] recently showed that *I. felix* can enhance primary producers in seagrass beds using this same experimental design. <!-- This should be (and is for the most part) covered above. So I suggest combining these two sentences to read something like:
Data from Archer et al. 2021 (paper and dryad citations here) were used to calculate seagrass structure and productivity and macroalgal structure. These variables were calculated from seagrass growth and seagrass and macroalgal abundance in the same plots measured at the same time as the community variables presented here. 

Then you can go into how productivity and structure variables were calculated from this data. -->
Thus, we use this data for the primary producer variables seagrass stucture, seagrass productivity, and macroalgal structure to use in our analysis [@Archer2021].\par
<!-- I think these next pieces are already included elsewhere. --> <!-- Agreed, 133-136 aren't needed-->
<!-- All predictor variables included in our model investigation were: treatment, sampling event, plot, seagrass productivity, seagrass structure, and macroalgal structure.  -->
<!-- Treatment (indicating sponge presence) was either sponge, structure, or control and was pre-assigned to individual plots prior to the experiment. -->
<!-- Sampling event was the months into the experiment the community data was collected at each plot (either 0, 1, or 12 months into the experiment). -->
<!-- Plot was a number 1-15 pre-assigned to sampling units prior to the experiment. -->
Seagrass productivity was calculated by multiplying the average  growth per shoot by the total shoot density for *Thalassia testudinum*.
Seagrass structure was calculated as the number of seagrass shoots (i.e. shoot density) for all seagrass species (*Halodule wrightii, Syringodium filiforme, and T. testudinum*) in 20 × 20  cm “sub-quadrats” at each sampling event.
Macroalgal structure was calculated as the total macroalgal abundance across all taxa at each sampling event.
Drift algae was not included. 
Seagrass productivity, seagrass structure, and macroalgal structure were centred and standardized by two standard deviations in order to allow effect size comparisons between continuous and factor covariates within models [@Schielzeth2010]. \par

## Statistical Analyses

*Total abundance and species richness*

<!-- Not sure if this sentence works better here or at the end? -->
All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.0 [@RCoreTeam2021]. 
First we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to confirm that none of the faunal groups differed in total abundance or species richness between the treatment groups at the start of the experiment (sampling month = 0).
<!-- We need to start with a clear statement of what the variables being analyzed here are...  -->
Next, we tested for differences in overall abundance and species richness of fish, non-clonal invertebrates, and clonal invertebrates among treatments using univariate Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), with the sponge treatment plots as the reference level.
<!-- Univariate analysis was performed on three community groups: fish, non-clonal invertebrates, and clonal invertebrates.  -->
<!-- The groups were assessed for differences among treatment types using a generalized linear mixed model, with the sponge treatment plots as the reference level. -->
We chose multiple model configurations to represent the biological hypotheses that could best explain community changes within treatment plots.
Specifically, treatment (i.e. sponge presence), seagrass productivity, seagrass structure, and macroalgal structure were each modeled separately and additively to represent sponge presence alone, three parts of primary production within the seagrass system, and the combined effects of changes in primary production and ~~other influences from~~ the presence of the sponge (Table S1-3).
<!-- When we are close to finalizing the text I think it will be a good idea to go through the manuscript and review where we refer to treatment vs sponge presence. I am not sure exactly where it should happen but I think we should at some point transition into calling it sponge presence (to remind people what it is we're actually trying to test there) and then be consistent from there on out. -->
Additionally, all models included a random effect for plot, sampling month as a factor, and for models including treatment an interaction between treatment and time.
<!-- Plot (as a random variable) and sampling were included in every model as predictor variables. -->
<!-- When treatment and sampling event were both in a model, an interaction was accounted for.  -->
All models were fit with a Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution, parametrized via the mean and a log link, and implemented using the glmmTMB package [@Brooks2017; @Huang2017].
<!-- Add statement about reviewing residuals-->
We used the package AICcmodavg [@Mazerolle2020] to create a model selection tables based on Akaike Information Criterion scores (AICc).
All models within two delta AICc of the best supported model are considered to be well-supported.\par
<!-- The model with the lowest AICc value was selected in the final analyses **Table 1**, however, models that were within two delta AICc's away from this model were further analyzed for thoroughness (see discussion and S1).\par -->

*Taxa Turnover*

Increases in species richness through time can result from either increases in colonization rates, or a reduction in the loss of species. 
To assess the relative rates at which taxa were gained or lost between sampling events, we used the turnover function in codyn package [@Hallett2020]. 
We assessed both components of taxa turnover separately for each faunal group in each plot, and compared patterns of turnover among treatments at 1 and 12 months into the experiment.\par

*Compositional Vectors*

To assess community changes in a way that simultaneously accounts for changes in species richness and abundance, we calculated compositional vectors for each faunal group in each plot. <!-- reference the McCune book here-->
<!-- To assess community changes in treatments across time (from 0 to 12 months into the experiment), compositional vectors were calculated for each plot in the fish, non-clonal invertebrate, and clonal invertebrate communities. -->
We used Hellinger's transformation to help minimize the effect of vast differences in abundance between taxa *(Legendre & Gallagher 2001)*.
We then conducted a principal components analysis (unconstrained by environmental predictors) using the `rda()` function in the vegan package [@Oksanen2020].
<!-- First, for each type of community data, a Hellinger's transformation was performed followed by an RDA using the vegan package(@Oksanen2020). -->
The scores from this analysis were used to calculate a vector length and angle **from 0 to 12 months into the experiment** for each plot as per *Mccune[]*. 
<!-- not sure if this is the best wording, but I think its important to make it clear the what the vectors are - they are the line from sampling point 0 to 12 for each plot-->
An ANOVA was performed on each community's <!-- need to be consistent here, each community or faunal group - I think I've seen faunal group more and don't mind that at all -->vector length and angle to test significant differences among treatments (sponge treatment as the reference level).
<!-- Do you think we need to cite base R package, stats, separately if we have already stated that all analyses were conducted in R? --> <!-- Nope I think you're good.-->
When significance occurred <!-- This wording is a bit awkard - maybe "When there were significant differences..."? -->, a post-hoc analysis via a Tukey *Honest Significant Difference* test was then performed to look at the differences in vector length and angle among treatments.
<!-- Is species space meaningful here, when we don't display species? If so, could it be explained a bit more? -->
For visualization purposes, all vectors were standardized to the same initial position and then plotted ~~across species space~~ <!-- These vectors aren't actually in species space anymore, that's why it was impossible to add the species onto these plots like we initially invisioned-->to show how much a community changed over time (i.e. vector length) and in which direction across species space <!-- I think its fine to leave species space here, because the angle was calculated in species space, its just that the final visualization isn't in species space--> the community shifted (i.e. vector angle).\par

## Total abundance and species richness 

*Fish*  

<!-- I think we need to start with some descriptive statistics, but not sure if this works  --> <!-- yes, we could add the total number of fish species seen across the study if we want. -->
At the start of the experiment between 0 and 2 individual fish, never of the same species, were found in each plot (mean = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 0, ]$f.abund),1)`). 
Slippery Dick (**relpace with scientific name**) were the most common species. 
One month later, the maximum number of individuals or species <!-- what? this is confusing me, I think separating out talking about abundance and richness might work better here. -->was up to 4 (mean abundance = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 1, ]$f.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 1, ]$spr),1)`) with Slippery Dick (**relpace with scientific name**) remaining most abundant species <!-- across treatment types?-->.
By the second summer of the experiment, the maximum number of individuals had increased to 7, belonging as many as 6 different species (mean abundance = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 12, ]$f.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(fish.uni[fish.uni$sampling == 12, ]$spr),1)`) and Grunts (**relpace with scientific name**) were slightly more abundant than Slippery Dicks (**relpace with scientific name**). <!-- you typically see means discussed with ranges and variance in the parentheticals -->

<!-- I've added the overall model results first ... -->
These changes in fish abundance and species richness were best explained by the treatment effect of sponge presence (Table 1 <!-- Add reference to supplemental tables here too-->), such that in the presence of a sponge fish abundance and species richness increased throughout the experiment (total abundance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,4)` and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,5)` at 1 and 12 months respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plots); species richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,4)` and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,5)` at 1 and 12 months respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)A).
<!-- Because we seem to have saved only the summary with sponge as reference, these coefficients aren't described correctly. These betas and CI represent the difference between month 12 in the real plots and month 12 in the control plots. I think it means this? --> <!-- what?-->
In contrast, changes were non-significant for both control and structure plots (**we could add stats here by saving models with different reference treatments**, Figs. \@ref(fig:ab-plots) and \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)A).
Only control plots ultimately differed significantly from sponge plots and this was not until the 12 month sample (total abundance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,8)`; species richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,8)`).\par

<!-- For reference, this was how it was worded before. These models are total mind-benders every time! -->
<!-- In the structure treatment, species richness and abundance increased at 1 month and decreased at 12 months, but neither changes were significant ( Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plot)). -->
<!-- After 1 and 12 months into the experiment, species richness and abundance in control plots decreased, though the change was only significant after 12 months (species richness: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fspr.treat.sum,8)`; species abundance: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(fa.treat.sum,8)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plot)).\par -->


*Invertebrates*

<!-- I noticed something called ground tunicate in the non-clonal dataframe. Is it supposed to be there? --> <!-- yes, its a solitary tunicate-->
At the start of the experiment between 0 and 4 individuals of non-clonal invertebrates from up to 3 species were found in each plot (mean abundance = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 0, ]$i.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 0, ]$spr),1)`). 
Snails were the most abundant taxa. 
One month later, the maximum number of individuals was up to `r range(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 1, ]$i.abund)[2]` of up to `r range(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 1, ]$spr)[2]` different species (mean abundance = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 1, ]$i.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 1, ]$spr),1)`) with more anemones and ceriths recorded than snails.
By the second summer of the experiment, the maximum number of individuals was `r range(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 12, ]$i.abund)[2]`, belonging as many as `r range(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 12, ]$spr)[2]` different species (mean abundance = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 12, ]$i.abund),1)` and mean richness = `r round(mean(inv.uni[inv.uni$sampling == 12, ]$spr),1)`) and snails were back to being most abundant, followed by Blue crabs (**relpace with scientific name**). 

Changes in non-clonal invertebrate abundance and species richness were also best explained by the treatment effect of sponge presence, but in both cases other models were equally well-supported (Table \@ref(table)).
Abundance of non-clonal invertebrates significantly increased after 1 and 12 months in the presence of a sponge ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,4)` and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,5)` respectively, Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plots)), but only after 12 months were abundances significantly lower in both control and structure plots than in sponge plots ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,8)` and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,9)` respectively).
Seagrass productivity appears to explain some of this change ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.prod.sum,6)`), but there was still a significant difference between structure and live sponge treatments after accounting for the differences in seagrass productivity ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.prod.sum,10)`).
Likewise, the model including seagrass structure was well-supported (Table 1); however, it's contribution does not reach significance ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.struct.sum,6)`) suggesting that new growth <!-- suggest changing this to productivity and ending the sentence after abundance.--> has some impact on the non-clonal invertebrate abundance beyond changes in stem density alone. 
Species richness also increased over time in the presence of a sponge ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,4)` at 1 month and $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,5)` at 12 months, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)).
After 12 months richness was found to be lower in both control and structure plots than in the sponge plots, although only significantly so for the latter (control: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,8)`; structure: $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,9)`).
However, this time the other well-supported model did not include a treatment effect suggesting that much of the effect of sponge might be accounted for by through differences in macroalgal structure facilitated by the presence of a sponge ($\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.alg.sum,4)`; Fig. \@ref(fig:inverts-by-algae)).<!-- reference our other paper here-->

We observed a maximum of 3 species of colonial tunicates (they only type of clonal invertebrate found) in any plot at any one time. 
Tunicate species richness did not change over time for any of the treatments and no covariates showed significant relationships in any of our candidate models (Table 1 and Fig. S2).


<!-- In the structure treatment, species richness and abundance  decrease at 1 and 12 months into the experiment, though change in species richness at 1 month was not significant (species richness: 12 months- $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ispr.treat.sum,9)`; species abundance: 1 month- $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,7)`; 12 months- $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,9)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plots)). -->
<!-- At 1 month into the experiment, species richness increased while species abundance decreased in control plots, though neither changes were significant( Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plots)). -->
<!-- Then, at 12 months into the experiment, both species richness and abundance in control plots decreased, but only species abundance was significant ( $\beta$ = `r efsize.tmb(ia.treat.sum,8)`, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots), Fig. \@ref(fig:ab-plots)).\par -->


<!-- *Clonal Invertebrates* -->

<!-- There were no significant differences between treatments for species richness of clonal invertebrates ( Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots)). -->
<!-- Species abundance could not be analyzed because an accurate count of individuals was not feasible.\par -->
<!-- I think this repeats what's already in the methods? And therefore the first sentence might reasonably be added to the previous paragraph? -->


## Species Turnover  

Between the start of experiment and the first experimental sample most plots in the all treatments gained more species than they lost (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots B left panel).
After a full year, however, sponge plots tended to gain the most new species while also still retaining more of the species they started with than either of the other plot types (plots high on the proportion gained y-axis and low on the proportion lost x-axis, Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots B right panel).
This pattern is similar for both fish and non-clonal invertebrates, although overall a lower proportion of fish than invertebrate species tended to be lost.
<!-- When comparing species turnover from 1 month to 12 months in sponge treatment plots, the overall turnover rates show an increase in species gained for fish and non-clonal invertebrates, which parallels the results from the univariate analysis (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots). -->
<!-- In structure and control plots there appears to be a decrease in species gained and increase in species lost for both fish and non-clonal invertebrates, also supporting the results from th univariate analyses (Fig. \@ref(fig:turnover-plots). \par -->
For clonal invertebrates, species turnover from 1 to 12 months did not show differences between treatment types in the proportion of species gained or lost (Fig. S2). 
The lack of differences in species turnover among treatments coincides with lack of change in species richness during the experiment. \par

## Compositional Vectors

By 12 months into the experiment, the fish communities differed significantly by treatment for both vector length and angle, meaning they differed in the how much they changed over time and in direction of change across species space (vector length:  F~`r aov.df2(fish.vl.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(fish.vl.aov.sum,1)`; vector angle: F~`r aov.df2(fish.angle.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(fish.angle.aov.sum,1)`). 
The post-hoc analysis of vector lengths showed a significant difference in how much the fish communities changed over time between the control and sponge treatments and between the structure and sponge treatments, with control and structure both having less change in community over time when compared to the sponge treatment plots (control-sponge: `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,1)` ; structure-sponge `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,2)`). 
However, there was no difference in the amount of change in the fish community between structure and control treatments (`r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,3)`). 
The post-hoc analysis of the vector angles showed no significant difference in the direction in which the fish communities shifted across species space between the control and sponge treatments, which may be due to the small change in the control plot communities over time (control-sponge: `r tukey.res(fish.angle.aov.tuk,1)` ; Fig. \@ref(fig:vector-plots)`). 
Contrastingly, there were differences in the direction of the communities across species space between the structure and sponge as well as between the structure and control, with structure plots having less change in communities across species space than both sponge or control (structure-sponge: `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,2)` ; structure-control `r tukey.res(fish.vl.aov.tuk,3)`). \par

By 12 months into the experiment, the non-clonal invertebrate communities per plot had no differences across treatments for vector length and angle, meaning they did not differ in the amount of change over time nor in direction of change across species space (vector length:  F~`r aov.df2(inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`; vector angle: F~`r aov.df2(inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`). 
~~Because there were no statistical differences, post-hoc analysis was not performed on the non-clonal invertebrates.~~ \par

Like the non-clonal invertebrates, the clonal invertebrate communities did not differ among treatments in the amount of change over time nor in the direction of change across species space (vector length:  F~`r aov.df2(col.inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(col.inv.vl.aov.sum,1)`; vector angle: F~`r aov.df2(col.inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`~ `r aov.res(col.inv.angle.aov.sum,1)`). 
~~Thus, no post-hoc analysis was performed on this group.~~ \par

# Discussion  

Ecosystem engineers can affect habitat structure, resource availability and location, and community structure and dynamics [@Jones1994; @Anderson1992; @Byers2006].
Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first *in situ* experiment testing the affect of the presence of *I. felix* on species richness, abundance, species turnover, and community compositional vectors as an ecosystem engineer in a subtropical seagrass ecosystem over a 1.5 year experiment.<!-- Extremely specific. I'd say break into two sentences, first about what we tested overall and second about how we did that i.e., we tested whether sponges act as ecosystem engineers in seagrass beds. We did this by examining the effect of I. felix on...-->
We found that sponge presence alone explained the most variance in fish and non-clonal invertebrate communities, while no changes in the clonal invertebrate community were detected.
In fish and non-clonal invertebrates, species richness and abundance increased over time with the presence of *I. felix* while decreasing or remaining the non-significantly changed without the sponge presence in seagrass ecosystems. 
Overtime, sponge presence increased species gained for fish and non-clonal invertebrates, while showing little to no change in species turnover for clonal invertebrates.
Finally, we found that sponge presence shifted the entire fish community over time and across species space. \par

This study presents the marine sponge, *I. felix*, as a single organism capable of affecting an ecosystem's community structure.
Although the sponge presence model explained the most variance among species richness and abundance in fish and non-clonal invertebrates, there were several models that fell within less than 2 delta AICc values for non-clonal invertebrates that cannot be ruled out **Table 1**.
First, for non-clonal invertebrate abundance, the sponge presence model had two closely competing models: sponge presence + seagrass productivity and sponge presence + seagrass structure.
Both of the models contained sponge presence as a predictor variable.
Also, it is worth noting that the model including all three variables (sponge presence + seagrass productivity + seagrass structure) did not fall within 2 delta AICc of the top model. <!-- Explain why that is worth noting-->
Further examination of the results of the sponge presence + seagrass productivity and sponge presence + seagrass structure showed non-clonal invertebrate abundance significantly increasing in the “sponge” treatment plots and either significantly decreasing or no significant changes in abundance in the “structure” and “control” treatment plots over time (SX). 
These results parallel the results in the sponge presence model. 
For non-clonal invertebrate species richness examination, only one other model was within 2 delta AICc of the sponge presence model: macroalgal structure. 
The macroalgal structure model showed that non-clonal invertebrate species richness increased over time as macroalgal structure increased, regardless of the treatment the plot was given. 
Notably, in Archer et al.[2021], macroalgal structure significantly increased over time in the presence of *I. felix*. \par

For clonal invertebrate species richness the top three models were seagrass structure, macroalgal structure, and seagrass productivity, respectively.
All three models showed no significant changes in clonal invertebrate species richness across time or treatment plots. 
For clonal invertebrates, it is possible that all the seagrass plots originally had a high species richness, and an effect on abundance occurred from the sponge presence. 
However, our research lacked a measurement for clonal invertebrate abundance and more research is needed to test this hypothesis. \par

For fish and non-clonal invertebrates alike, we saw a maintenance and/or a shift towards species gained after 12 months (Fig). Although there was little change in the sponge plots in terms of proportion of species lost, the number of species within the plots increased (indicated by the enlargement of the plot points) (FIG).
Univariate analysis of the clonal invertebrates showed no significant change in time or across treatments.
However, comparing 1 month to 12 months into the experiment, the sponge treatment plots shifted slightly away from species lost and towards/ non changing species gained (FIG).
Control and structure plots showed increase in both species gain and lost after 12 months. \par

Deciphering communal shifts over time through compositional vectors was statistically significant for fish only. 
For the most part, control treatment plots did not change over time in the fish communities and can be portrayed by the lack of control arrows present in Fig X()
Two major fishes contributing to the shift across species space in the sponge treatment plots were grunts and damselfish.
Other research has shown grunts to be sponge associated****Steph do you have a citation for this?****.\par

Non-clonal invertebrate communities across treatments did not have significant differences.
There was a wide range of change throughout time and across species space in the control treatment plots for non-clonal invertebrates.
The sponge treatment plots similarly shifted throughout time and species space, with Ceriths being a dominant species contributing to that shift (FIG).
Similarly, clonal invertebrate communities across treatments did not have significant differences and a wide range of change in the control plots.
However, sponge treatment plots clonal invertebrate communities shifted in similar direction and angle (i.e. over time and across species space), with black and orange tunicates being a high contributor to this shift. \par
	It is important to understand ecosystem engineers affects on the organisms around them because it can result in changes in the community structure and dynamics, therefore indirectly influencing ecosystem functions and services provided by the community.
We studied the effect of the presence of an ecosystem engineer, *I felix*, on species richness, abundance, turnover, and community composition in low impact seagrass beds and found that sponge presence can increase species richness and abundance, maintain turnover rates, and shift fish communities.
Thus, this study is another in situ example of how an ecosystem engineer can affect an entire community while other ecosystem engineers exist within that system.
Additional research is needed to explore which aspects of *I. felix* influences seagrass bed communities, and if the affect changes in impacted systems. \par
<!-- Need to add in comparisons to what is known about how other ecosystem engineers (particularly structure forming ones) contribute to biodiversity. And bring in any other literature about sponge effects on biodiversity in other systems-->
