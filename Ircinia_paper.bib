  abstract = {Foundation species, such as oysters, corals, and seagrasses, form the basis for entire ecosystems and are characterized by positive interactions with community members. However, many species interactions are context dependent, where the outcome or strength of the interaction depends on the biotic or abiotic conditions. Therefore, a mechanistic knowledge of species interactions, especially those involving foundation species, may allow for a more complete understanding of how anthropogenic changes influence nearshore ecosystems. This study describes the interaction between the seagrass Thalassia testudinum and the sponge Halichondria melanadocia, a species that grows around the base of seagrass shoots. A combination of surveys and experimental manipulations on Abaco Island, The Bahamas, revealed that the interaction between T. testudinum and H. melanadocia is a commensal relationship with the sponge benefiting from the presence of T. testudinum up to medium shoot densities (589\textendash 615 shoots per m2). The net neutral effect of H. melanadocia on T. testudinum is likely a balance of the negative effect of the sponge shading the seagrass with the positive effect of nitrogen and phosphorus supplied by the sponge. The mechanisms underlying the interaction between H. melanadocia and T. testudinum suggest that the interaction is likely context dependent. As such, environmental change, namely eutrophication, has the potential to shift the nature of this interaction from commensal to parasitic. A simple simulation showed that if this relationship becomes parasitic, above ground production in seagrass beds could be reduced. This study highlights the importance of a mechanistic understanding of species interactions involving foundation species when predicting human impact on the environment.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs typically occur in oligotrophic waters, where tight recycling of energy and nutrients is essential in order to support their high productivity. Sponges are efficient filter feeders that host diverse and abundant microbial communities that often contain members capable of carrying out complex nutrient transformations. Consequently, sponges often act as significant sources of bioavailable forms of nitrogen and phosphorus while acting as sinks for dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, little attention has focused on variability of nutrient release by sponges and no studies have reported how abiotic conditions may impact sponge-driven changes in nutrient concentrations. Here, we show that a common Caribbean sponge, Ircinia felix, is capable of being both a source and a sink for DOC, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite (NO2x ), and phosphate (PO432). Additionally, we show that abiotic conditions, particularly ambient nutrient availability, seem to explain a significant amount of the variability (R2 range from 0.40 to 0.65). Interestingly, as ambient nutrient concentrations increased, I. felix transitioned from acting as a source to serving as a sink for all nutrient forms measured. We also found I. felix-associated bacteria exhibit a significantly higher abundance of predicted nitrogen metabolism, carbon fixation, and photosynthetic genes relative to ambient water and sediment. These results suggest that sponges play an important and dynamic role in biogeochemical cycling on reefs, particularly as human activities alter natural nutrient dynamics in coastal systems.},

  abstract = {Nutrient loading is a common human impact in coastal habitats which is driving significant losses of seagrass habitat worldwide. This is concerning, as seagrass beds provide numerous ecosystem services. Although nutrient loading can result in eutrophication and mass mortality of seagrasses, it more often results in subtle alterations of abiotic conditions which, by themselves, are insufficient to drive widespread seagrass mortality. Here we used a month-long field-based experiment to test the influence of anthropogenic nutrient loading on the outcome of an interaction between an epizootic sponge (Halichondria melanadocia) and a seagrass (Thalassia testudinum). Using a factorial design we manipulated ambient nutrient concentrations by adding fertilizer to plots with and without a sponge in a relatively pristine seagrass bed on Abaco Island, The Bahamas. We measured seagrass growth, below- and above-ground biomass, and the change in shoot density. We found that low levels of nutrient loading (i.e., insufficient to cause increased algal growth and decreased oxygen levels associated with eutrophication) resulted in a non-significant increase in seagrass growth, biomass, and shoot density when a sponge was absent. When a sponge was present, the same level of fertilization resulted in a significant reduction in the response variables. Our results show that anthropogenic nutrient loading can shift the sponge-seagrass interaction away from commensalism toward an interaction that has negative consequences for the seagrass. Additionally, a shift in the outcome of this context-dependent interaction can alter the impact of nutrient loading on seagrass productivity. Our study provides an example of how simple classifications of interspecific interactions (e.g., commensalism) often mask underlying variability. Characterizing the mechanisms driving the variability will allow us to understand when and how the outcome of an interaction will change. Ultimately, this will allow us to better predict how human activities will indirectly impact various ecosystem functions.},

Here, we investigated the potential for cockles to impact the productivity of seagrass, Zostera muelleri, and examined interactions between these habitat-defining species where they co-occur. We sampled bivalve densities and sizes, sediment properties, and seagrass shoot densities across the boundaries of two seagrass patches on an intertidal sandflat in northern New Zealand, and measured dissolved oxygen and nutrient fluxes in light and dark benthic incubation chambers in conjunction with a 0e97\% gradient in seagrass cover. Although gross primary production (GPP, mmol O2 m\`A2 h\`A1) increased predictably with the cover of live seagrass, the density of cockles and sediment properties also contributed directly and indirectly. Seagrass cover was positively correlated with cockle density (ranging from 225 to 1350 individuals per m2), sediment mud percentage (0.5e9.5\%), and organic matter content (0.5e2.2\%), all of which can affect the efflux of ammonium (readily utilisable inorganic nitrogen) from sediments. Moreover, the cover of green seagrass blades plateaued (never exceeded 70\%) in the areas of highest total seagrass cover, adding complexity to cockle-seagrass interactions and contributing to a unimodal cockleGPP relationship.},

In seagrass ecosystems, facilitation ensures the survival and resilience of this important habitat. As seagrass meadows are in decline, innovative restoration strategies incorporating facilitative interactions could open new avenues in marine restoration. Here, we investigated the interactions between eelgrass Zostera marina and the Baltic clam Macoma balthica, and tested whether clams could enhance early survival and biomass increase of transplanted eelgrass shoots in the northern Baltic Sea. We measured eelgrass responses to differing densities of clams, as well as porewater ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43-) concentrations in field and aquarium experiments. Overall, survival of transplanted plots was high, independent of clam density. Specifically, we found that clams facilitated eelgrass above- and below-ground biomass in low porewater nutrient conditions, potentially through nutrient release, but inhibited growth in high-nutrient conditions, particularly where clams were added at high densities. Our results show the important role of infaunal bivalves for nutrient fluxes within seagrass meadows. Most notably, we highlight the importance of considering and testing context- and density-dependency when studying interspecific interactions, as clams could both benefit and hamper Zostera biomass increase. This becomes particularly crucial when incorporating such interactions in a restoration context.},

  abstract = {Suspension feeding bivalves are commonly associated with seagrass habitats in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Biodeposits of some suspension feeding bivalves have been shown to be high in nitrogen and phosphorus. Consequently, filter feeding bivalves may act as a benthopelagic couple bringing planktonic production to the benthos, thereby elevating submerged aquatic vegetation growth by increasing the nutrients available to the rhizosphere. Laboratory feeding experiments were used to calculate the filtration rate of a typical suspension feeding bivalve Modiolus americanus. Filtration rates were estimated to be 2.8760.82 l h21 g tissue dry weight21. Consumption rates were estimated to be 9.4162.62 mg Chl a h21 g tissue dry weight21. In addition, field experiments were used to calculate mean biodeposition rates. Biodeposition rates were estimated to be 2.2560.36 g dry wt material g tissue dry weight day21. Therefore, at mean field densities M. americanus are capable of depositing 218 kg dry weight material m22 annually. These deposits will contain 215 g N and 7.1 g P. A flower pot experiment demonstrated that the biodeposits of M. americanus were capable of increasing the pore water nutrient content and a mussel density manipulation in the field revealed that the presence of mussels significantly reduced leaf tissue C:N and C:P ratios. Pore water ammonium and phosphate concentrations were four times greater in the highest mussel density than in the control treatments and the lower leaf tissue C:N and C:P ratios in the presence of mussels established that this increased pore water nutrient was available to the seagrass, Thalassia testudinum. Collectively, these experiments suggest that suspension feeding bivalves may be important resource conduits converting inaccessible PON and POP in the water column to elevated sediment nutrient levels within the rhizosphere available for absorption by submerged aquatic vegetation. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, these large foundation species are threatened by disturbances and stressors, including invasive species, sedimentation and heatwaves. It is unknown whether `alternative' foundation species can replace lost southern bull kelps and its associated communities and networks. We compared community structure (by quantifying abundances of different species) and attachment-interaction networks (by quantifying which species were attached to other species) among plots dominated by Durvillaea spp. and plots where Durvillaea spp. were lost either through long-term repeated experimental removals or by recent stress from a marine heatwave. Long-term experimental removal plots were dominated by `alternative' foundation species, the canopy-forming Cystophora spp. (Fucales), whereas the recent heatwave stressed plots were dominated by the invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida (Laminariales). A network analysis of attachment interactions showed that communities differed among plots dominated by either Durvillaea spp., Cystophora spp. or U. pinnatifida, with different relationships between the primary, or alternative, foundation species and attached epiphytic `secondary' foundation species. For example, native Cystophora spp. were more important as hosts for secondary foundation species compared to Durvillaea spp. and U. pinnatifida. Instead, Durvillaea spp. facilitated encrusting algae, which in turn provided habitat for gastropods. We conclude that (a) repeated disturbances and strong stressors can reveal ecological differences between primary and alternative foundation species, (b) analyses of abundances and attachment-networks are supplementary methods to identify linkages between primary, alternative and secondary foundation species, and (c) interspersed habitats dominated by different types of foundation species increase system-level biodiversity by supporting different species-abundance patterns and species-attachment networks.},

However, seagrasses are in crisis as global coverage is declining at an accelerating rate. With increased focus on ecological restoration as a conservation strategy, methods that enhance restoration success need to be explored. Decades of work in coastal plant ecosystems, including seagrasses, has shown that positive species relationships and feedbacks are critical for ecosystem stability, expansion, and recovery from disturbance. We reviewed the restoration literature on seagrasses and found few studies have tested for the beneficial effects of including positive species interactions in seagrass restoration designs. Here we review the full suite of positive species interactions that have been documented in seagrass ecosystems, where they occur, and how they might be integrated into seagrass restoration. The few studies in marine plant communities that have explicitly incorporated positive species interactions and feedbacks have found an increase in plant growth with little additional resource investment. As oceans continue to change and stressors become more prevalent, harnessing positive interactions between species through innovative approaches will likely become key to successful seagrass restoration.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems worldwide depend on habitat-forming foundation species that often facilitate themselves with increasing density and patch size, while also engaging in facultative mutualisms. Anthropogenic global change (e.g., climate change, eutrophication, overharvest, land-use change), however, is causing rapid declines of foundation species-structured ecosystems, often typified by sudden collapse. Although disruption of obligate mutualisms involving foundation species is known to precipitate collapse (e.g., coral bleaching), how facultative mutualisms (i.e., context-dependent, nonbinding reciprocal interactions) affect ecosystem resilience is uncertain. Here, we synthesize recent advancements and combine these with model analyses supported by real-world examples, to propose that facultative mutualisms may pose a doubleedged sword for foundation species. We suggest that by amplifying self-facilitative feedbacks by foundation species, facultative mutualisms can increase foundation species' resistance to stress from anthropogenic impact. Simultaneously, however, mutualism dependency can generate or exacerbate bistability, implying a potential for sudden collapse when the mutualism's buffering capacity is exceeded, while recovery requires conditions to improve beyond the initial collapse point (hysteresis). Thus, our work emphasizes the importance of acknowledging facultative mutualisms for conservation and restoration of foundation species-structured ecosystems, but highlights the potential risk of relying on mutualisms in the face of global change. We argue that significant caveats remain regarding the determination of these feedbacks, and suggest empirical manipulation across stress gradients as a way forward to identify related nonlinear responses.},

  abstract = {Seagrasses and suspension feeders are both critical ecosystem engineers in estuaries. Seagrass beds are important structural habitats, and suspension feeders, when abundant, can regulate phytoplankton densities. Furthermore, there may be mutual facilitation of growth and recruitment between seagrasses and suspension-feeding bivalves. In a series of mesocosm experiments, the effects of environmentally realistic densities of 3 different suspension-feeding bivalves (Mercenaria mercenaria, Crassostrea virginica, Mytilus edulis) on the growth of eelgrass Zostera marina in a eutrophied environment were examined. Experimental treatments with bivalves consistently yielded significantly lower chlorophyll a concentrations (p {$<$} 0.05), and most bivalve treatments also showed significant increases in light penetration (p {$<$} 0.05). Eelgrass productivity was measured by leaf area growth, and varied from 0.318 {$\pm$} 0.018 to 0.832 {$\pm$} 0.036 cm2 shoot\textendash 1 d\textendash 1 (mean {$\pm$} SE); leaf area productivity was always significantly higher (on average, 48 {$\pm$} 9.3\% higher) in the treatments with the highest density of bivalves compared to a control without bivalves (p {$<$} 0.05). The data indicate that clearance of the water column, and the subsequent increase in light penetration, was the primary mechanism by which suspension-feeding bivalves facilitated the growth of eelgrass. These findings suggest that healthy populations of suspension-feeding bivalves can mitigate the effects of estuarine eutrophication and can facilitate the growth of seagrass in degraded, light-limited habitats.},

  abstract = {Invertebrate diversity can be a key driver of ecosystem functioning, yet understanding what factors influence local biodiversity remains uncertain. In many marine and terrestrial systems, facilitation cascades where primary foundation and/or autogenic ecosystem engineering species promote the settlement and survival of a secondary foundation/engineering species have been shown to enhance local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We experimentally tested if a facilitation cascade occurs among eelgrass (Zostera marina), pen clams (Atrina rigida), and community diversity in temperate seagrass beds in North Carolina, U.S.A., and if this sequence of direct positive interactions created feedbacks that affected various metrics of seagrass ecosystem function and structure. Using a combination of surveys and transplant experiments, we found that pen clam density and survivorship was significantly greater in seagrass beds, indicating that eelgrass facilitates pen clams. Pen clams in turn enhanced local diversity and increased both the abundance and species richness of organisms (specifically, macroalgae and fouling invertebrate fauna)\textemdash the effect of which scaled with increasing clam density. However, we failed to detect an impact of pen clams on other seagrass functions and hypothesize that functioning may more likely be enhanced in scenarios where secondary foundation species specifically increase the diversity of key functional groups such as epiphyte grazers and/or when bivalves are infaunal rather than epifaunal. Our findings add to the growing amount of literature that demonstrates that secondary foundation species are important drivers of local biodiversity in marine ecosystems. Further experimentation is needed that directly examines (i) the role of functional versus overall diversity on seagrass functions and (ii) the relative importance of life-history strategy in determining when and where engineering bivalves increase biodiversity and/or functioning of seagrass beds.},
