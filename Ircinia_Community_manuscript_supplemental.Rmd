Figure S1. Illustrates the experimental design and sampling scheme. Data was collected prior to treatment establishment, and 1 and 12 months after treatments were established. Fish abundance and taxa richness were counted for whole plots. Other taxonomic groups and seagrass measurements were made in the locations indicated.

Figure S2. Change in clonal invertebrate species richness and the components of species turnover from start of experiment to the first experimental sample (1 month into experiment), and between that first experimental sample and one year later (12 months into experiment). All species encountered were tunicates.
